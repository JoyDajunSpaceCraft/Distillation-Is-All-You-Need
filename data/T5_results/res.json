This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart. Symptoms of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy", "Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.", "Right ventricular hypertrophy. Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.", "Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1  High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.  Aortic valve stenosis.", "Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH)."], "reason": "Here is the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\":\n\n[4] > [2] > [5] > [1] > [3]\n\nReasoning:\n- [4] specifically mentions high blood pressure as the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy, directly addressing the query.\n- [2] provides a detailed explanation of left ventricular hypertrophy and its causes, including factors like high blood pressure and heart conditions.\n- [5] discusses ventricular hypertrophy in general, mentioning both left and right ventricular hypertrophy, which is relevant to understanding the context of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n- [1] talks about right ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular septal defect, which are not directly related to the query about left ventricular hypertrophy.\n- [3] focuses on right ventricular hypertrophy and its causes, which are not directly related to the query about left ventricular hypertrophy.", "scores": ["0", "2", "0", "2", "1"], "t5_reason": "Here is the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the search query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\": [1] > [2] > [4] > [5] Reasoning: - [1] provides a detailed description of right ventricular hypertrophy, including its causes and risk factors, making it the most relevant to the search query. - [2] discusses the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, including high blood pressure and heart condition, which is relevant to the query. - [3] discusses the causes of right ventricular hypertrophy, including its causes and risk factors, which is relevant to the query but not as directly related to the query as the other passages. - [4] discusses the causes of right ventricular hypertrophy, including its causes and risk factors, which is not directly related to the query about the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\n"}
