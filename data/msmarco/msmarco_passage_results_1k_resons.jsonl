There are two types of modifiers in the English language: the adjective and the adverb. They have distinctly different roles, and we will examine each, in turn. First, let's look at the definition of each word.An adjective describes, or modifies a noun--a person, place, thing, or idea.Adjectives may be single words, or they may be whole phrases. The adverb is different from an adjective in that it primarily modifies verbs, but it may also modify adjectives or other adverbs.here are two types of modifiers in the English language: the adjective and the adverb.
