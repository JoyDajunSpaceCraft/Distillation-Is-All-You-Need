[6] The clinical trial design and design of the new coronavirus-associated virus (RAS-CoV-2) vaccine are described in the abstract. The vaccine is administered to susceptible individuals at a later stage of the disease process. The vaccine is contraindicated if the person is exposed to a person with a previous case of coronavirus.
