The size of butterfly needles ranges from 18 to 27 gauge bore. The higher the number, the thinner the needle gets. This is why 21G and 23G are the most common, while 25G and 27G are mostly avoided, because it is believed to clot or hemolyze the blood samples, making them invalid for blood tests. Types of Butterfly Needles Standard safety device ; This type of needle has been the industry standard for many years. Two of its most common sizes are 21G and 23G.

Some paints will have a small percentage of epoxy added to the mix to make it more durable than standard paint, but it is still paint. These are known as epoxy paints or 1-part epoxy paint. Epoxy is an actual thermosetting resin that is applied as a coating. It is formed when you mix one part epoxide resin with one part polyamine hardener. The hardener acts as a catalyst and is what gives epoxy its strength. Unlike paint that has to dry, epoxy cures. When the two parts are mixed, a chemical reaction is started which creates an exothermic curing process.

In the process of fermentation the NADH + H +from glycolysis will be recycled back to NAD so that glycolysis can continue. In the process of glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to form NADH + H +. If NAD is not present, glycolysis will not be able to continue. During aerobic respiration, the NADH formed in glycolysis will be oxidized to reform NAD+ for use in glycolysis again. When oxygen is not present or if an organism is not able to undergo aerobic respiration, pyruvate will undergo a process called fermentation. Fermentation does not require oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. Fermentation will replenish NAD+ from the NADH + H+ produced in glycolysis. One type of fermentation is alcohol fermentation.
