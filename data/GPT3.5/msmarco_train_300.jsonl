It is used to access a superficial vein for phlebotomy or IV injections.

The size of butterfly needles ranges from 18 to 27 gauge bore. The higher the number, the thinner the needle gets. This is why 21G and 23G are the most common, while 25G and 27G are mostly avoided, because it is believed to clot or hemolyze the blood samples, making them invalid for blood tests. Types of Butterfly Needles Standard safety device ; This type of needle has been the industry standard for many years. Two of its most common sizes are 21G and 23G.

Fermentation does not require oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. Fermentation will replenish NAD+ from the NADH + H+ produced in glycolysis. One type of fermentation is alcohol fermentation.
