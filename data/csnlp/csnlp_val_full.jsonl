Case investigations detected 3 cases with severe cutaneous injuries described in this article.CASES: There were 57 probable cases of box jellyfish stings between 2008 and 2013. Three of these injuries resulted in dermal necrosis, and 2 were associated with severe wound complications. A Thai man aged 21 years sustained wounds on his left knee and thigh. He received oral antibiotics and daily wet dressings; he did not receive steroids. He subsequently developed blisters, swelling of the lower left leg, neuritis, and severe itching in the later stages. Nevertheless, his wounds did not become infected and there was no keloid scarring. An American woman aged 25 years sustained stings on her right hand and arm. She received antibiotic ointment and a tape that was placed directly on the wound without any gauze or padding underneath. She developed a wound infection 2 weeks postinjury. Surgical debridement was required twice to remove necrotic tissue; keloid scars persisted on evaluation at 4 months. An American woman aged 33 years received stings on her left upper thigh. Initial treatment was provided by local residents, who crushed morning glory leaves to extract the juice and then applied the juice (mixed with water) to her wounds. She received intravenous steroids, oral antihistamines, oral analgesics, and antibiotic cream at the hospital. Despite this aggressive treatment, the wounds became gangrenous and surgical debridement was required to remove necrotic tissue.CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be knowledgeable regarding the potentially serious wounds that can develop following jellyfish stings. Additional research is needed to identify best management approaches.", "label": 1}

Case 1 was a 10-year-old boy visiting us because of pain and swelling in his right scrotum continuing for the past ten days. His right scrotum was found to contain a hen-egg sized tender mass. The testis and epididymis could not be differentiated by palpation. The blood count disclosed 10,000 white blood cells. At operation, two appendix epididymis were found in his right scrotum. One of them was twisted 360 degrees clockwise and 10 x 8 x 5 mm in size. Case 2 was a 11-year-old boy with complaint of pain in his left lower abdomen and left scrotum for the past three days. Palpation of his left scrotal contents revealed a slightly hard testis and tender epididymis. At operation, we found his left spermatic cord to be twisted 90 degrees counterclockwise and appendix epididymis 180 degrees counterclockwise. The twisted appendix epididymis was 10 x 8 x 7 mm in size. Case 3 was a 13-year-old boy whose complaint was left scrotal pain. The upper pole of his left testis was found to be swollen and tender by palpation. The exposure of his left scrotum at operation revealed that his left epididymis was abnormally attached to his left testis and had two appendices. One of these appendix epididymis was twisted 180 degrees clockwise and measured 10 x 10 x 8 mm. Case 4 was a 19-year-old male who suffered from right testicular pain for the past seven days.

We report a phosgene exposure that resulted in the patient's death.CASE REPORT: A 58 year-old man arrived to the emergency department 1 hour after exposure to phosgene with complaints of a sore throat. Initial vital signs were blood pressure 175/118 mmHg, heart rate 98/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Physical exam revealed few scattered rhonchi, without signs of distress. Initial arterial blood gases (ABG's) revealed pH 7.42, pCO2 43 mmHg, pO2 68 mmHg, HCO3 27 meq/L, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Initial chest x-ray 2 hours after the exposure demonstrated clear lung fields. Approximately 2.5 hours after the exposure, he began complaining of dyspnea, restlessness and his oxygen saturation dropped below 90%. He received nebulized albuterol, 1 gram intravenous methylprednisolone, and 100 % oxygen via face mask. Minimal improvement was noted and he was intubated. The post intubation chest x-ray, 3.5 hours after the exposure, revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Acetylcysteine, terbutaline, and IV steroids were administered without improvement. The patient died 30 hours after exposure.DISCUSSION: There are many misunderstandings concerning phosgene due to its rare presentation. Traditional treatment modalities are often unproven in human trials and were unsuccessful in this case.CONCLUSION: This case highlights the significant toxicity that results from phosgene exposure and the challenges of the limited treatment modalities. There is concern for the use of this agent in chemical terrorism.", "label": 0}

In adults, HSV type 1 is found predominantly in the oral area, and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) is commonly found in the genital area. HSV-2 infection without genital lesions is uncommon. Herein we report a unique case of pharyngotonsillitis as an initial manifestation of disseminated HSV-2 infection without genital involvement.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and sore throat. His past medical history included hypereosinophilic syndrome diagnosed at age 45\u2009years. Physical examination revealed throat congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy in the left posterior triangle, and mild epigastric tenderness. The laboratory data demonstrated bicytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear showed hypocellular marrow with histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The diagnosis of HLH was confirmed, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy on days 1-3. On day 5, despite initial improvement of the fever and sore throat, multiple, new, small bullae developed on the patient's face, trunk, and extremities. Additional testing showed that he was positive for HSV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Disseminated HSV infection was suspected, and intravenous acyclovir (10\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h) was begun. A subsequent direct antigen test of a bulla sample was positive for HSV-2. Moreover, tonsillar and esophageal biopsies revealed viral inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed the presence of HSV-2. Disseminated HSV-2 infection with multiple bullae, tonsillitis, esophagitis, and suspected hepatic involvement was diagnosed. After a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir, his hematological status and liver function normalized, and his cutaneous skin lesions resolved. He was discharged on day 22 in good general health and continued taking oral valacyclovir for viral suppression due to his immunosuppressed status.CONCLUSION: Disseminated HSV-2 infection should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and impaired liver function of unknown etiology even if there are no genital lesions.", "label": 0}

He worked as a ranger at Ken-Ting Farm in southern Taiwan, and had been to Thailand for sight-seeing 5 years ago. He came to our outpatient department about one month prior to hospitalization for intermittent fever of one week duration. At that time, complete blood count was within normal limits and a chest roentgenogram was unremarkable. He was given erythromycin without showing any clinical improvement. Two days prior to admission, he noted pain in the left hip. The next day, severe dyspnea developed suddenly and chest x-ray film revealed bilateral nodular lesions. Physical examination on hospitalization revealed an acutely ill and jaundiced male with a temperature of 37.4 degrees C, blood pressure: 110/47 mmHg, pulse rate: 137/min, and respiratory rate: 26/min. There were rales in both lungs, but no lymphadenopathy or organ enlargement. Laboratory study showed WBC: 1,470/mm(3), platelet count: 47,000/mm(3), blood sugar: 226 mg/dL, mildly elevated transaminases and bilirubin, and BUN: 69 mg/dL, Cr: 4.3 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated an acute metabolic acidosis with PaO2 of 32 mmHg. Despite the initial impression of melioidosis and administration of ceftazidime plus gentamicin, his condition rapidly deteriorated and expired 18 hours after admission. Two sets of blood cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis has been called a great imitator of diseases and culture results are frequently misinterpreted. The mortality is high even with suggested therapy with ceftazidime, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, and/or tetracycline. There has been a total of 10 cases reported in southern Taiwan and 2 of them were clearly indigenous.

The S. bovis group has been recently reclassified and renamed as Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. We report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named S. bovis biotype I). A 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. Initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic valves. Antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. The infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. The strain was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the Vitek 2 GPI and API 20 Strep systems (bioM?rieux, USA). The 16S rDNA sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in GenBank. The identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer. The patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer.

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation of the mitral and the aortic valve. The presence of continuous bacteremia was confirmed by multiple sets of blood culture, whereby gram-positive cocci was retrieved and identified as Staphylococcus saprophyticus (S. saprophyticus) both phenotypically and genetically. Because two major criteria of the Modified Duke Criteria were met, the patient was diagnosed with native valve endocarditis due to S. saprophyticus. The urine culture was also positive for gram-positive cocci, phenotypically identified as Staphylococcus warneri, which was subsequently identified as S. saprophyticus with the use of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry), indicating strongly that the intermittent catheterization-associated urinary tract infection resulted in bacteremia that eventually lead to infective endocarditis. This patient was treated with vancomycin and clindamycin. Because of multiple cerebral infarctions, the patient underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement on hospital day 5. Blood culture turned negative at 6th hospital day. Antibiotic therapy was continued for six weeks after surgery. The patient's clinical course was uneventful thereafter, and was discharged home.

We aimed to establish a baseline of knowledge regarding the prevalence of MRSA in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well as S. aureus antimicrobial susceptibility to current available antimicrobials, while also determining those most effective to treat S. aureus infections.METHODS: Samples were collected from patients at two main Health facilities in Kabul between September 2016 and February 2017. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by the disc diffusion method and studied using standard CLSI protocols.RESULTS: Out of 105 strains of S. aureus isolated from pus, urine, tracheal secretions, and blood, almost half (46; 43.8%) were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) while 59 (56.2%) were Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All strains were susceptible to vancomycin. In total, 100 (95.2%) strains were susceptible to rifampicin, 96 (91.4%) susceptible to clindamycin, 94 (89.5%) susceptible to imipenem, 83 (79.0%) susceptible to gentamicin, 81(77.1%) susceptible to doxycycline, 77 (77.1%) susceptible to amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid, 78 (74.3%) susceptible to cefazolin, 71 (67.6%) susceptible to tobramycin, 68 (64.8%) susceptible to chloramphenicol, 60 (57.1%) were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 47 (44.8%) susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 38 (36.2%) susceptible to azithromycin and erythromycin, 37 (35.2%) susceptible to ceftriaxone and 11 (10.5%) were susceptible to cefixim. Almost all (104; 99.05%) were resistant to penicillin G and only 1 (0.95%) was intermediate to penicillin G. Interestingly, 74.6% of MRSA strains were azithromycin resistant with 8.5% of them clindamycin resistant. Ninety-six (91.4%) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant.CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of Methicillin resistance (56.2%) among S. aureus strains in the samples collected and most (91.4%) were multidrug resistant. The most effective antibiotics to treat Staph infections were vancomycin, rifampicin, imipenem, clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, gentamicin and doxycycline. The least effective were azithromycin, ceftriaxone, cefixim and penicillin. We recommend that, where possible, in every case of S. aureus infection in Kabul, Afghanistan, Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) should be performed and responsible use of antibiotics should be considered.", "label": 1}

Neuropsychological tests demonstrated impairment of recent memory and calculation. Pleocytosis (83/microl) and increase of protein (1269 mg/dl) and IgG (141 mg/dl) in the CSF were observed. Brain MRI showed multiple nodular lesions with high intense signal on T2-weighted images and Gd-DTPA enhancement on T1-weighted images. Chest CT showed multiple nodular lesions in the bilateral lungs. The needle lung biopsy was performed, which showed infiltration of lymphocytes around the vessels. An immunohistochemical study showed that the infiltrating cells were mainly CD8 positive T lymphocytes. B lymphocyte and plasma cells were not seen. The histological findings excluded intravascular malignant lymphoma and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Therefore we diagnosed lymphoid vasculitis. The patient developed pancytopenia caused by hemophagocytic syndrome 48 days after admission and was treated with 1 g of methylprednisolone per day for 3 days and a tapered dose of steroid (500 mg to 125 mg of methylprednisolone and 60 mg to 10mg of predonisolone) for 21 days, which resulted in the improvement of clinical features (hemophagocytic syndrome and central nervous system symptoms) and the abnormal CSF findings.

The patient refused biopsies at this visit. Given the patient's previous diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, it was thought that the skin lesions might represent ulcerative cutaneous sarcoidosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum was also considered to be a likely diagnosis.

At posttest counseling, a physician interviewed donors to clarify possible sources of infection.RESULTS: A total of 167 repeat donors and 404 new donors were interviewed: 33 with HIV, 123 with HCV, 279 with HBV, 21 with HTLV, and 112 with syphilis antibodies. Most HBV, HCV, and HTLV infections were among new donors (80, 85, and 67%), whereas most HIV infections were among repeat donors (79%). Nearly 25 percent of the donors did not report factors at screening that would have deferred them from donating blood. At posttest interviews, new donors with HCV often reported injecting drug use (19%). Repeat donors with HIV often reported male-to-male sex (8/26, 31%).CONCLUSION: A significant level of deferrable behavioral risks was found among donors with confirmed transfusion-transmissible infections that persist despite current donor selection. Reporting such behavior at initial donor selection would have eliminated a substantial part of the infections found. This study argues against relaxing the existing donor deferral of persons practicing male-to-male sex, given their significant proportion of HIV infections among repeat donors. Systematic surveillance of risk factors among infected blood donors provides ongoing information about the effectivity of donor selection and is recommended to evaluate and optimize blood policies.", "label": 1}

However, recently human papillomavirus, a cofactor in the genesis of cervical cancer, has been confirmed. A case of squamous intraepithelial lesion after S haematobium infection is presented, and the relation between schistosomiasis, human papillomavirus and squamous intraepithelial lesion, with long-term follow-up by Papanicolaou smear, is discussed.CASE: A 33-year-old, normal, healthy woman with a history of Copper intrauterine device (IUD) use for 3.9 years presented for her annual contraceptive follow-up. Her Pap smear revealed inflammation with a S haematobium egg. She was followed up with Pap smears for 4 years. Retrospective contraceptive history revealed use ofa copper IUD on 5 occasions with a total duration of 13 years and 1 month. Similarly, annual follow-up of Pap smears for the past 13 years showed mild inflammation with bacterial vaginitis and monilial infection. Subsequent smears showed an Actinomyces-like organism and then human papillomavirus infection with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance followed by human papillomavirus-associated low/high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.CONCLUSION: Caution is required while screening routine Pap smears. Apart from nuclear abnormalities, one can observe unusual findings. Long-term followup by Pap smear following detection of S haematobium revealed that in the absence of human papillomavirus, S haematobium alone is not the causative agent for the abnormal proliferation of squamous epithelium of the cervix. Genital Schistosomia acts as a cofactor by traumatizing the genital epithelium or immune suppression to favor human papillomavirus infection.", "label": 0}

", "knowledge": "BACKGROUND: All patients undergoing tympanomastoid surgery should be assessed post-operatively for a 'dead ear'; however, tuning forks are frequently inaccessible.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that smartphone-based vibration applications provide equivalent accuracy to tuning forks when performing Weber's test.METHODS: Data were collected on lay participants with no underlying hearing loss. Earplugs were used to simulate conductive hearing loss. Both the right and left ears were tested with the iBrateMe vibration application on an iPhone and using a 512 Hz tuning fork.RESULTS: Occluding the left ear, the tuning fork lateralised to the left in 18 out of 20 cases. In 20 out of 20 cases, sound lateralised to the left with the iPhone (chi-square test, p = 0.147). Occluding the right ear, the tuning fork lateralised to the right in 19 out of 20 cases. In 19 out of 20 cases, sound lateralised to the right with the iPhone (chi-square test, p &gt; 0.999).CONCLUSION: Smartphone-based vibration applications represent a viable, more accessible alternative to tuning forks when assessing for conductive hearing loss.

She had been treated in jail with magnesium hydroxide, ordered as milk of magnesia 30 mL po each night and Maalox 30 mL po three times daily. Additional medications included lithium carbonate 300 mg po three times daily, chlorpromazine 150 mg po three times daily, benztropine mesylate 1 mg po twice daily, and docusate sodium 100 mg po each morning. Her temperature was 35.1 degrees C, blood pressure 108/58 mm Hg, heart rate 112 beats/min, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min. She would respond only briefly to voice or painful stimuli. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. Laboratory tests included serum magnesium concentration 9.1 mEq/L (normal 1.3-2), blood urea nitrogen 16 mg/dL (8-22), creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (0.5-1.1), calcium 3.9 mEq/L (4.2-5.2), and lithium 1.0 mEq/L. A laparotomy was performed, and an adhesive band from a previous oophorectomy was found to be compressing the sigmoid colon. Hypermagnesemia, hypothermia, and hypotension continued in the intensive care unit. Despite successful treatment of the hypermagnesemia with calcium, intravenous fluids, and furosemide, the patient's cardiac rhythm degenerated into fatal, pulseless electrical activity on postoperative day 2.DISCUSSION: This case of severe hypermagnesemia from magnesium hydroxide ingestion illustrates many of the risk factors for hypermagnesemia in patients with normal renal function. People using magnesium-containing medications for relief of gastrointestinal distress may be at increased risk for hypermagnesemia. A brief review of magnesium physiology, clinical effects, and treatment is provided. Frequent use of the laboratory to identify hypermagnesemia is encouraged because it is often a clinically unexpected finding and responds well to early treatment.", "label": 0}

Due to acute epigastric pain and intermittent fever with night sweat for one week he was admitted for further investigation. On physical examination there was tenderness in the right upper and lower epigastrium without a palpable mass.INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory figures showed signs of inflammation with a CRP of 103 mg/l. Leucocyte counts were normal without left shift. CT and MRI scans showed a sharp-edged mass of 10 x 8 cm in diameter in the retroperitoneal area with big vessels running through it. Laparoscopic biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of retractile mesenteritis.TREATMENT AND COURSE: Under therapy with oral progesterone (Utrogestan 1 x 100 mg/d) and prednisone (Prednison 1 x 50 mg/d) there was fast symptomatic relief. A CT scan 2 months after initial diagnosis showed clear regression of the tumor.CONCLUSION: Retractile mesenteritis is a rare cause of chronic abdominal pain with variable symptoms. Its aetiology is unknown. In case of bowel ischemia a surgical approach is preferred, milder forms may be treated with immunosuppressive agents as well as oral progesterone. Progesterone has exhibited positive effects on fatty tissue with successful treatment in desmoid tumors and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

The associated increases in maternal morbidity and healthcare costs indicate the need for alternative strategies. Operative vaginal delivery is minimally utilized in Ecuador, as neither vacuum nor forceps have been available.OBJECTIVE: As vacuum delivery was recently introduced to our clinical service, we sought to examine our initial experiences (i.e., maternal and neonatal outcome) with operative vaginal delivery for prolonged second stage of labor.METHODS: Following an initial educational program at the Enrique C. Sotomayor Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Guayaquil, Ecuador, vacuum extraction cups (Mityvac, Cooper Surgical) were offered to laboring women with term singleton gestations and cephalic presentations no higher than +3 station. Maternal and neonatal data were analyzed.RESULTS: During the study period, 100 vacuum applications were performed on laboring women complicated with prolonged second stage of labor. Mean maternal age was 23.8 +/- 6.4 years (range 14-41 years) with 57% of patients nulliparous. Left anterior and right posterior fetal positions were the most frequent (85% and 11%, respectively). Maternal complications included need for blood transfusion (1%), shoulder dystocia (1%) and perineal tears (first degree 6%, second degree 5%). Vaginal delivery was successful in 97% of cases. Among neonates, the average weight was 3149 +/- 410 g, with 10% neonates small for gestational age and 5% large for gestational age. Only 1% of infants presented an Apgar score <7 at 5 min. There were no scalp lacerations, cephalohematomas, or subgaleal bleeds.CONCLUSIONS: In this initial observational study, vacuum extraction for prolonged second stage was safe and effective.

His mother made the appointment for a health supervision visit although she had concerns about his language and social skills. She stated that he spoke primarily with unintelligible sounds and often communicated by pointing with his finger. He spoke only 10 words that were clear enough to be understood. Jimmy's mother said that he could hear, but she was not sure whether he understood everything she said. Although he played at home with his 4-year-old brother, he typically played by himself when he was in the presence of other children. Jimmy's mother was asked if he had had a 2-year-old visit to a pediatrician and what the assessment was at that time. She said that his delayed development was discussed with the pediatrician, but she was reassured that he would progress during the following year. An uncomplicated full-term gestation was followed by a vaginal delivery without perinatal problems. Jimmy was a \"calm\" baby who was breastfed for the first 6 months of life. He sat at 7 months, pulled himself up to stand with support at approximately 9 months, and walked at 13 months. Transitions were always difficult for Jimmy; he screamed and was difficult to settle whenever cared for by someone other than his parents. He typically resists physical contact when children or adults approach him. His mother recalled that language emerged early. He acquired a significant number of words between 12 and 15 months of age. Jimmy apparently recognized letters when his parents were teaching the older sibling. At 15 months, Jimmy's language output regressed dramatically, and by 18 months, he no longer used words to communicate. Since then, he has spoken fewer than 10 single words. He mostly babbles and uses repetitions of the same sounds. The pediatrician inquired into family structure and life events at the time Jimmy lost language milestones. He was told that, at this time, the father, an engineer, changed his position in the company and began to travel extensively. Jimmy's mother thought that the absence of his father might be related to the language regression. She also noted that Jimmy seemed to have a stronger attachment for his father: \"Jimmy has always been attracted to his father, and his brother seems to prefer me.\" The parents' marriage was strong and free of any major disharmony. During the interview, the pediatrician noted that Jimmy played persistently with his set of small trains, repetitiously lining them up in order. He was not interested in other toys that were on the floor next to him. He ran around the trains, mostly on his toes, while making unintelligible sounds. He looked away when the pediatrician called his name and became agitated when his mother attempted to redirect his attention to the examination. The pediatrician, 4 years in practice after his residency, had never seen a child with Jimmy's pattern of development.

A cranial nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan had been performed at her previous visit. The scan exhibited a nodular mass lesion involving the left cavernous sinus. CT angiography was subsequently used to determine that the lesion was a giant aneurysm in the left cavernous internal carotid artery, causing enlargement of the left ophthalmic veins.

Loss of accommodation is one of the lesser known and less common complications of peripheral retinal laser photocoagulation. In fact, only a few works concerning this issue have been published so far. Deficit of accommodation has been described only after extensive laser treatment of the peripheral retina. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case that reports this complication after treatment limited to a small retinal area. We discuss the possible pathogenetic mechanism of this phenomenon.CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old healthy myopic woman came to the eye clinic for flashes and floaters in her right eye. Fundus evaluation revealed a small horseshoe retinal tear at the 6 o'clock position. She was treated with prophylactic retinal laser barrage in the right eye. Twelve days later, she returned to our Retinal Clinic because of difficulty with near vision. The problem started soon after the laser procedure. On examination, her distance visual acuity was 20/20 wearing her glasses. The patient could read J1+ at 33 cm with the left eye and required a +3.00D addition over her corrective lens to read J1+ with the right eye. The accommodative disturbance resolved itself spontaneously and gradually within 3 months of laser treatment.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that transient loss of accommodation, although rare, should be included during pretreatment discussion with young patients regarding the possible side effects of laser photocoagulation, even if this is limited to a small area of the peripheral retina.", "label": 1}

Other than blurred vision in the right eye, she complained of a mild frontal headache and right eye irritation the past week, which had abated. On examination, she was reading a book with her head tilted to one side. She had no photophobia, or facial or eyelid swelling. Her pupils were 5 mm bilaterally, but the right was non-reactive to light. She was unable to see two fingers 6 inches in front of her face (right eye), whereas her visual acuity on the left was 20/25. She had bilateral elevated intraocular pressures and a Marcus Gunn pupil on the right. Ophthalmology was consulted and the diagnosis of acute sphenoid sinusitis causing compression and vascular compromise to the optic nerve was diagnosed ultimately by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was transferred to the nearest pediatric specialty hospital, where an emergent endoscopic sphenoidotomy was performed.

DH is classified as a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease, a type of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (1). The treatment of DH includes dapsone and a gluten-free diet (GFD). Other therapies should be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate dapsone, including sulfapyridine and glucocorticoids. Herein we present two cases of DH with good responses to tetracycline and niacinamide combination therapy. Case 1 was a 42-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with a 3-year history of recurrent pruritic papules and bullous lesions involving the trunk and upper limbs. On examination, the patient showed disseminated erythematous papules on the upper limbs and back as well as vesicles. Nikolsky's sign for vesicles was negative (Figure 1, a-c). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges. He did not have a history of chronic diarrhea. The histologic examination showed subepidermal blisters and accumulation of neutrophils at the papillary dermis of the involved ski. Direct immunofluorescence revealed fibrillar deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 1. g, h). Case 2 was a 34-year-old woman who had a history of skin rash and pruritic lesions predominantly involving the arms and legs, which had been present for 10 months. She had been treated with prednisone (30 mg daily) with improvement; however, the lesions reappeared when the prednisone was discontinued. She had a history of constipation. On physical examination, the skin lesions manifested as erythematous papules, vesicles, and scabs on the limbs (Figure 2. a-c). She felt apparently pruritic. The histologic examination of the biopsy identified subepidermal blisters with a neutrophil infiltrate in the upper dermis. Direct immunofluorescence revealed granular deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 2. e, f). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges, with the exception of elevated IgE concentration (222.5 ku/L (normal range, 0-100 ku/L)). The clinical manifestations and histologic and immunofluorescence examinations of the two cases confirmed the diagnosis of DH. The two patients were subsequently started on a strict GFD. At that time, dapsone was not available in the hospital. The patients were treated with oral tetracycline (500 mg four times daily) and nicotinamide (500 mg three times daily). The rash affecting case 1 resolved entirely in 2 weeks. The patient discontinued the medications after 6 months, and occasionally presented with a few pruritic papules and vesicles, but the lesions resolved within 1 week. The lesions affecting case 2 completely healed within 1 month. The patient continued taking those medications and no recurrence of the skin lesions occurred during 2 years of follow-up. Dapsone is considered first-line therapy for patients with DH (2). Recent findings have shown dapsone and lower dosages of sulfasalazine combination therapy in DH are effective and well-tolerated (3). Alternative monotherapeutic agents in mild autoimmune bullous diseases such as DH include a tetracycline group of antibiotics with niacinamide or its derivatives as well as sulfasalazine. Because dapsone is dif?cult to obtain in China except for patients with leprosy, we treated the patients with tetracycline and nicotinamide. To our knowledge, only a few cases of DH have been successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide (2,4). One of the patients was also prescribed heparin (4). Tetracycline has anti-inflammatory properties due to the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity and mast cell activation (5). Nicotinamide is a potent modulator of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nicotinamide can inhibit cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-) from immune cells, inhibit chemotaxis and degranulation of immune cells, inhibit lymphocyte blast transformation, and suppress T-cell activity (6). The non-antibiotic properties of tetracycline in combination with nicotinamide may participate in inhibition of antibody formation, modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in?ammatory cell accumulation, lymphocyte transformation, and T-cell activation. In summary, we reported two typical cases of DH that were successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide, which completely healed the rash and relieved the symptoms within 1 month. The combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide can be recommended as a useful therapy for patients where dapsone is not available or for patients who do not tolerate dapsone.", "label": 1}

The proband was a 25-yr-old Thai woman who was encountered with the presence of mild hypochromic microcytosis with Hb 8.2 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) 26.0%, Mean Corpuscular Value (MCV) 68.6 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 21.6 pg and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) 31.5 g/dL. Although Hb electrophoresis at alkaline pH did not show any abnormal band except Hb E in addition to Hb A, high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed abnormal peaks at the Hb A and Hb E positions. DNA analysis of the proband revealed a GAG-GAT mutation at codon 27 of the minor alpha1-globin gene for Hb Hekinan in trans to the South-east Asian (SEA) deletional alpha-thalassemia 1 determinant and a GAG-AAG mutation at codon 26 of the beta-globin gene for Hb E.

He had suffered two episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis during the last day. In addition, over the previous 12 h, he presented brown urine without dysuria. His mother and brother had suffered from gastroenteritis over the previous week without bloody diarrhea. On initial physical examination, there was a 6-cm x 11-cm macular tender purpuric plaque with a central punctum on the right inner calf, which was warm and tender to the touch, with erythematous streaking towards the popliteal fossa (Fig. 1). The inguinal area was also erythematous with tender lymphadenopathy and induration, but without fluctuance.

At home, she will walk through doorways multiple times and at school, she will pretend she forgot something so her friends do not notice. She often will not walk downstairs and occasionally her mother has to carry her. Clothes are problematic for Chloe. If her father touches something of a specific color and then touches Chloe, she will have to change her clothes or take a shower. Sometimes, she will never be able to wear those clothes again. She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame. During the 2 weeks before the pediatric visit, symptoms increased to the point that she is now refusing to go to school. When she stays home, she lays in 1 place all day.Chloe is a fourth grade student. The family does not report academic concerns. She has friends. She denies any appetite or sleep problems. She endorses periods of sadness, lack of energy, and decreased interest in social activities, mostly because she worries and is embarrassed. She kept her behaviors hidden from her 5 siblings for the past year, and she talked only to her mother about them. She is worried her friends might discover her behaviors.The family history is notable for multiple paternal family members with anxiety and bipolar disorder and depression on mother's side. A few months ago, Chloe's family adopted a 7-year-old child with special needs from China.Her growth, vital signs, and physical examination are unremarkable.

Secondly, a 55-year-old woman was afraid of her memory performances. She was medical secretary and had no problem in her work but she would like a memory consultation to reassure herself. She was neither depressed nor anxious. She presented curious production in fluency task.

She explained how she was bound to range everything in alphabetic order! She had a lot of rituals. She thought that she had an obsessive compulsive disorder but never consulted about this. The observation illustrated suspiscions about memory operations which could be observed in patients group with obsessive compulsive disorders. Finally, a 62-year-old man told us that he had presented a transient global amnesia during 4 hours. He had an important appointment and was upset about that. He didn't go to it and wandered in his flat. He always asked the same questions and forgot everything. He had no neurological deficit. He was anxious, sad and cried several times.

We report successful pregnancies in two such women.PATIENTS: The first patient was a 20-year-old woman transferred from a community hospital at 33 3/7 weeks gestation because of preterm labor, suspected preeclampsia, and mild chronic hypoxemia. She had normal systemic ventricular shortening without significant valvar regurgitation but severe neoaortic dilatation. A fetal ultrasound demonstrated intrauterine growth restriction. An urgent Cesarean section was performed at 33 6/7 weeks gestation, given breech position and intractable preterm labor. The second patient, a 23-year-old woman followed at this institution through pregnancy, presented with preterm labor at 36 weeks gestation. Her systemic ventricular shortening was normal, with mild tricuspid regurgitation but without neoaortic dilation or regurgitation.

Nine variables were chosen as evaluating parameters, including pre-salbutamol forced expired volume in one second(FEV1)/forced vital capacity(FVC) ratio, pre-salbutamol FEV1, percentage of post-salbutamol change in FEV1, residual capacity, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide/alveolar volume adjusted for haemoglobin level, peak expiratory flow(PEF) variability, serum IgE level, cumulative tobacco cigarette consumption (pack-years) and respiratory symptoms (cough and expectoration). Subjects' different clinical phenotype by hierarchical cluster analysis and two-step cluster analysis was identified.RESULTS: (1) Four clusters were identified by hierarchical cluster analysis. Cluster 1 was chronic bronchitis in smokers with normal pulmonary function. Cluster 2 was chronic bronchitis or mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with mild airflow limitation. Cluster 3 included COPD patients with heavy smoking, poor quality of life and severe airflow limitation. Cluster 4 recognized atopic patients with mild airflow limitation, elevated serum IgE and clinical features of asthma. Significant differences were revealed regarding pre-salbutamol FEV1/FVC%, pre-salbutamol FEV1% pred, post-salbutamol change in FEV1%, maximal mid-expiratory flow curve(MMEF)% pred, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity per liter of alveolar(DLCO)/(VA)% pred, residual volume(RV)% pred, total serum IgE level, smoking history (pack-years), St.George's respiratory questionnaire(SGRQ) score, acute exacerbation in the past one year, PEF variability and allergic dermatitis (P<0.05). (2) Four clusters were also identified by two-step cluster analysis as followings, cluster 1, COPD patients with moderate to severe airflow limitation; cluster 2, asthma and COPD patients with heavy smoking, airflow limitation and increased airways reversibility; cluster 3, patients having less smoking and normal pulmonary function with wheezing but no chronic cough; cluster 4, chronic bronchitis patients with normal pulmonary function and chronic cough. Significant differences were revealed regarding gender distribution, respiratory symptoms, pre-salbutamol FEV1/FVC%, pre-salbutamol FEV1% pred, post-salbutamol change in FEV1%, MMEF% pred, DLCO/VA% pred, RV% pred, PEF variability, total serum IgE level, cumulative tobacco cigarette consumption (pack-years), and SGRQ score (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: By different cluster analyses, distinct clinical phenotypes of chronic airway diseases are identified.

", "knowledge": "OBJECTIVE: Physical trauma affects 1 in 12 pregnant women and has a major impact on maternal mortality and morbidity and on pregnancy outcome. A multidisciplinary approach is warranted to optimize outcome for both the mother and her fetus. The aim of this document is to provide the obstetric care provider with an evidence-based systematic approach to the pregnant trauma patient.OUTCOMES: Significant health and economic outcomes considered in comparing alternative practices.EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library from October 2007 to September 2013 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., pregnancy, Cesarean section, hypotension, domestic violence, shock) and key words (e.g., trauma, perimortem Cesarean, Kleihauer-Betke, supine hypotension, electrical shock). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English between January 1968 and September 2013. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to February 2014. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.VALUES: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1).BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: This guideline is expected to facilitate optimal and uniform care for pregnancies complicated by trauma. Summary Statement Specific traumatic injuries At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the practice of disabling air bags for pregnant women. (III) Recommendations Primary survey 1. Every female of reproductive age with significant injuries should be considered pregnant until proven otherwise by a definitive pregnancy test or ultrasound scan. (III-C) 2. A nasogastric tube should be inserted in a semiconscious or unconscious injured pregnant woman to prevent aspiration of acidic gastric content. (III-C) 3. Oxygen supplementation should be given to maintain maternal oxygen saturation > 95% to ensure adequate fetal oxygenation. (II-1B) 4. If needed, a thoracostomy tube should be inserted in an injured pregnant woman 1 or 2 intercostal spaces higher than usual. (III-C) 5. Two large bore (14 to 16 gauge) intravenous lines should be placed in a seriously injured pregnant woman. (III-C) 6. Because of their adverse effect on uteroplacental perfusion, vasopressors in pregnant women should be used only for intractable hypotension that is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation. (II-3B) 7. After mid-pregnancy, the gravid uterus should be moved off the inferior vena cava to increase venous return and cardiac output in the acutely injured pregnant woman. This may be achieved by manual displacement of the uterus or left lateral tilt. Care should be taken to secure the spinal cord when using left lateral tilt. (II-1B) 8. To avoid rhesus D (Rh) alloimmunization in Rh-negative mothers, O-negative blood should be transfused when needed until cross-matched blood becomes available. (I-A) 9. The abdominal portion of military anti-shock trousers should not be inflated on a pregnant woman because this may reduce placental perfusion. (II-3B) Transfer to health care facility 10. Transfer or transport to a maternity facility (triage of a labour and delivery unit) is advocated when injuries are neither life- nor limb-threatening and the fetus is viable (? 23 weeks), and to the emergency room when the fetus is under 23 weeks' gestational age or considered to be non-viable. When the injury is major, the patient should be transferred or transported to the trauma unit or emergency room, regardless of gestational age. (III-B) 11. When the severity of injury is undetermined or when the gestational age is uncertain, the patient should be evaluated in the trauma unit or emergency room to rule out major injuries. (III-C) Evaluation of a pregnant trauma patient in the emergency room 12. In cases of major trauma, the assessment, stabilization, and care of the pregnant women is the first priority; then, if the fetus is viable (? 23 weeks), fetal heart rate auscultation and fetal monitoring can be initiated and an obstetrical consultation obtained as soon as feasible. (II-3B) 13. In pregnant women with a viable fetus (? 23 weeks) and suspected uterine contractions, placental abruption, or traumatic uterine rupture, urgent obstetrical consultation is recommended. (II-3B) 14. In cases of vaginal bleeding at or after 23 weeks, speculum or digital vaginal examination should be deferred until placenta previa is excluded by a prior or current ultrasound scan. (III-C) Adjunctive tests for maternal assessment 15. Radiographic studies indicated for maternal evaluation including abdominal computed tomography should not be deferred or delayed due to concerns regarding fetal exposure to radiation. (II-2B) 16. Use of gadolinium-based contrast agents can be considered when maternal benefit outweighs potential fetal risks. (III-C) 17. In addition to the routine blood tests, a pregnant trauma patient should have a coagulation panel including fibrinogen. (III-C) 18. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma should be considered for detection of intraperitoneal bleeding in pregnant trauma patients. (II-3B) 19. Abdominal computed tomography may be considered as an alternative to diagnostic peritoneal lavage or open lavage when intra-abdominal bleeding is suspected. (III-C) Fetal assessment 20. All pregnant trauma patients with a viable pregnancy (? 23 weeks) should undergo electronic fetal monitoring for at least 4 hours. (II-3B) 21. Pregnant trauma patients (? 23 weeks) with adverse factors including uterine tenderness, significant abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, sustained contractions (> 1/10 min), rupture of the membranes, atypical or abnormal fetal heart rate pattern, high risk mechanism of injury, or serum fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL should be admitted for observation for 24 hours. (III-B) 22. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to all rhesus D-negative pregnant trauma patients. (III-B) 23. In Rh-negative pregnant trauma patients, quantification of maternal-fetal hemorrhage by tests such as Kleihauer-Betke should be done to determine the need for additional doses of anti-D immunoglobulin. (III-B) 24. An urgent obstetrical ultrasound scan should be undertaken when the gestational age is undetermined and need for delivery is anticipated. (III-C) 25. All pregnant trauma patients with a viable pregnancy who are admitted for fetal monitoring for greater than 4 hours should have an obstetrical ultrasound prior to discharge from hospital. (III-C) 26. Fetal well-being should be carefully documented in cases involving violence, especially for legal purposes. (III-C) Obstetrical complications of trauma 27. Management of suspected placental abruption should not be delayed pending confirmation by ultrasonography as ultrasound is not a sensitive tool for its diagnosis. (II-3D) Specific traumatic injuries 28. Tetanus vaccination is safe in pregnancy and should be given when indicated. (II-3B) 29. Every woman who sustains trauma should be questioned specifically about domestic or intimate partner violence. (II-3B) 30. During prenatal visits, the caregiver should emphasize the importance of wearing seatbelts properly at all times. (II-2B) Perimortem Caesarean section 31. A Caesarean section should be performed for viable pregnancies (? 23 weeks) no later than 4 minutes (when possible) following maternal cardiac arrest to aid with maternal resuscitation and fetal salvage.

Physical examination showed a firm, nontender mass located longitudinally and coinciding with the deltoid, measuring 12?14?4 cm. There was no limitation in range of motion or functioning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans suggested a lobulated, heterogeneous mass with multiple areas of calcification that raised suspicion for soft tissue sarcoma vs myositis ossificans. Marginal resection of the soft tissue mass was performed, and pathologic studies confirmed the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous myositis ossificans with dystrophic calcifications and central cystic degeneration. At 2-week follow-up, the patient had improved range of motion and pain, but he noted a second soft tissue mass in the left deltoid. The MRI and CT scans showed a 10.5?16?3.4-cm linear, lobulated lesion with multiple calcifications, similar in appearance to the contralateral deltoid. The patient admitted to frequently injecting anabolic steroids into his deltoids. Because the patient was asymptomatic on the left side and the MRI appearance of the left deltoid mass was similar to that of the myositis ossificans seen on the right side, the patient opted for nonsurgical treatment. This is a rare case of myositis ossificans occurring bilaterally in the deltoids after repeated injections of anabolic steroids.

", "knowledge": "Trichotillomania (TTM) is defined by the Diagnostics and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DMS-IV) as hair loss from a patient`s repetitive self-pulling of hair. The disorder is included under anxiety disorders because it shares some obsessive-compulsive features. Patients have the tendency towards feelings of unattractiveness, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (1,2). It is a major psychiatric problem, but many patients with this disorder first present to a dermatologist. An 11-year-old girl came to our department with a 2-month history of diffuse hair loss on the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area (Figure 1). She had originally been examined by a pediatrician with the diagnosis of alopecia areata. The patient`s personal history included hay fever and shortsightedness, and she suffered from varicella and mononucleosis. Nobody in the family history suffered from alopecia areata, but her father has male androgenetic alopecia (Norwood/Hamilton MAGA C3F3). The mother noticed that the child had had changeable mood for about 2 months and did not want to communicate with other persons in the family. The family did not have any pet at home. At school, her favorite subjects were Math and Computer Studies. She did not like Physical Education and did not participate in any sport activities during her free time. This was very strange because she was obese (body-mass index (BMI) 24.69). She was sometimes angry with her 13-year-old sister who had better results at school. The girl had suddenly started to wear a blue scarf. The parents did not notice that she pulled out her hair at home. Dermatological examination of the capillitium found a zone of incomplete alopecia in the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area, without inflammation, desquamation, and scaring. Hairs were of variable length (Figure 1). There was a patch of incomplete alopecia above the forehead between two stripes of hair of variable length (Figure 2). The hair pull test was negative along the edges of the alopecia. Mycological examination from the skin capillitium was negative. The trichoscopy and skin biopsy of the parietotemporal region of the capillitium (Figure 3) confirmed trichotillomania. Laboratory tests (blood count, iron, ferritin, transferrin, selenium, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, serology and hormones of thyroid gland) were negative. We referred the girl for ophthalmologic and psychological examination. Ophthalmologic examination proved that there was no need to add any more diopters. The psychological examination provided us with a picture in which she drew her family (Figure 4). The strongest authority in the family was the mother because she looked after the girls for most of the day. She was in the first place in the picture. The father had longer working hours and spent more time outside the home. He worked as a long vehicle driver. He was in the second place in the picture. There was sibling rivalry between the girls, but the parents did not notice this problem and preferred the older daughter. She was successful at school and was prettier (slim, higher, curly brown hair, without spectacles). Our 11-years-old patient noticed all these differences between them, but at her level of mental development was not able to cope with this problem. She wanted to be her sister's equal. The sister is drawn in the picture in the third place next to father, while the patient's own figure was drawn larger and slim even though she was obese. Notably, all three female figures had very nice long brown hair. It seemed that the mother and our patient had better quality of hair and more intense color than the sister in the drawing. The only hairless person in the picture was the father. The girl did not want to talk about her problems and feelings at home. Then it was confirmed that our patient was very sensitive, anxious, willful, and withdrawn. She was interested in her body and very perceptive of her physical appearance. From the psychological point of view, the parents started to pay more interest to their younger daughter and tried to understand and help her. After consultation with the psychiatrist, we did not start psychopharmacologic therapy for trichotillomania; instead, we started treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, mild shampoo, mild topical steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%) in solution and methionine in capsules. With parents' cooperation, the treatment was successful. The name trichotillomania was first employed by the French dermatologist Francois Henri Hallopeau in 1889, who described a young man pulling his hair out in tufts (3-5). The word is derived from the Greek thrix (hair), tillein (to pull), and mania (madness) (5). The prevalence of TTM in the general adult population ranges from 0.6% to 4%, and 2-4% of the general psychiatric outpatient population meet the criteria for TTM (2-5). The prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at less than 1% (5). The disease can occur at any age and in any sex. The age of onset of hair pulling is significantly later for men than for women (3). There are three subsets of age: preschool children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. The mean age of onset is pre-pubertal. It ranges from 8 to 13 years (on average 11.3 years) (2-5). The occurrence of hair-pulling in the first year of life is a rare event, probably comprising <1% of cases (5). The etiology of TTM is complex and may be triggered by a psychosocial stressor within the family, such as separation from an attachment figure, hospitalization of the child or parent, birth of a younger sibling, sibling rivalry, moving to a new house, or problems with school performance. It has been hypothesized that the habit may begin with \"playing\" with the hair, with later chronic pulling resulting in obvious hair loss (2). Environment is a factor because children usually pull their hair when alone and in relaxed surroundings. The bedroom, bathroom, or family room are \"high-risk\" situations for hair-pulling (5). Men and women also differed in terms of the hair pulling site (men pull hair from the stomach/back and the moustache/beard areas, while women pull from the scalp) (3). Pulling hair from siblings, pets, dolls, and stuffed animals has also been documented, often occurring in the same pattern as in the patient (5). Genetic factors contributing to the development of TTM are mutations of the SLITRK1 gene, which plays a role in cortex development and neuronal growth. The protein SAPAP3 has been present in 4.2% of TTM cases and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be involved in the development of the spectrum of OCD. A significantly different concordance rate for TTM was found in monozygotic (38.1%) compared with dizygotic (0%) twins in 34 pairs (3). The core diagnostic feature is the repetitive pulling of hairs from one`s own body, resulting in hair loss. The targeted hair is mostly on the scalp (75%), but may also be from the eyebrows (42%), eyelashes (53%), beard (10%), and pubic area (17%) (3,5). There are three subtypes of hair pulling - early onset, automatic, and focused. Diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV criteria are (2,3,5): 1) recurrent pulling of one`s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss; 2) an increasing sense of tension immediately prior to pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior; 3) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair; 4) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g., a dermatologic condition); 5) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The differential diagnosis includes alopecia areata (Table 1) (6), tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, secondary syphilis, traction alopecia, loose anagen syndrome, lichen planopilaris, alopecia mucinosa, and scleroderma (2-5). Biopsy of an involved area (ideally from a recent site of hair loss) can help to confirm the diagnosis (5). On histologic examination, there are typically increased numbers of catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation. Chronic hair pulling induces a catagen phase, and more hairs will be telogen hairs. Pigment casts and empty anagen follicles are often seen. Perifollicular hemorrhage near the hair bulb is an indicator of TTM (2). Complications of TTM are rare, but they comprise secondary bacterial infections with regional lymphadenopathy as a result of picking and scratching at the scalp. Many patients play with and ingest the pulled hairs (e.g. touching the hair to lips, biting, and chewing). Trichophagia (ingestion of the hair) can lead to a rare complication named trichobezoar (a \"hair ball\" in stomach). This habit is present in approximately 5% to 30% of adult patients, but it is less frequent in children. Patient with trichophagia present with pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Radiologic examination and gastroscopy should not be delayed (2,4,5). The management of the disease is difficult and requires strong cooperation between the physician, patient, and parents. The dermatologist cannot take part in the therapy, strictly speaking, but without the psychological, psychopharmacologic, and topic dermatologic treatment a vicious circle will be perpetuated.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of pregnancy outcome in women over age 50 who conceived using donor oocytes. This study presents the pregnancy and delivery data on two women who delivered at age 52.CASES: Case 1 was a 51-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, whose three children had been conceived with her first husband more than 20 years previously. She had remarried 18 years before presentation and had been actively trying to conceive for the last 7 years. She was diagnosed as being in menopause based on elevated gonadotropins, amenorrhea, and failure to have progesterone-withdrawal menses. She conceived on her first embryo transfer cycle with embryos derived from donor oocytes and fertilized by her husband's sperm (oocytes were donated by a woman who was undergoing retrieval for in vitro fertilization). During pregnancy she remained healthy, but had uterine prolapse at 20 weeks. She delivered a normal healthy male at 40.5 weeks; cesarean was performed because of a presumptive diagnosis of fetal distress after 3 hours of labor, when monitoring revealed fetal heart decelerations. Case 2 was also a 51-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 4, who wished to conceive with her second husband's sperm through the donor oocyte program. She had amenorrhea of 2 years' duration and elevated gonadotropins. Conception occurred after fertilization of a donor oocyte by her husband's sperm. She had an uneventful pregnancy, but labor was induced at 38 weeks' gestation given the supposed high-risk status of this age group. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.CONCLUSION: Theoretically, the risks of pregnancy complications in older patients are magnified given the aging maternal cardiovascular system, which may predispose these women to placental insufficiency. These first two cases of donor oocyte pregnancies in women over age 50 found no maternal or fetal age-related complications. We hope these reports will encourage all researchers to share their findings so that prospective patients can make better, more informed decisions as to whether they want to participate in donor oocyte programs.", "label": 0}

Case; A thirty-one year old male patient was brought to our outpatient's clinic by ambulance because of conscious loss and convulsive seizure on Feb. 5th, 1974. Lumbar puncture showed grossly hemorrhage in the CSF. Immediately he was hospitalized and administered anticonvulsants, hypotensive drugs, antibrinolytic agents and corticosteroid. His signs and symptoms on admission were mild headache, nausea, nuchal rigidity, anisocoria (right greater than left) and left hyper reflexia. This attach was his second. (He first noted the bleeding attack on January 30, 1974). Four hours after this attack cerebral angiography was done under local anesthesia with heavy premedication. Puncture of common carotid arteries were uneventful. Three injections of 60% Conray, at the dose of 8 ml each, were performed and three films were taken. Few minutes after injections, he suddenly became unconscious and ceased respiration for a few seconds. Blood pressure was 210 mmHg at systolic, although 120 mmHg two minutes before. Immediately resuscitation started. His respiration reappeared within 0.5 minute and his vital signs gradually improved. We stopped examination. When returned to his bed, right pupil dilated and optic fundi showed bleeding bilaterally. Arteriography showed a large dumbbell shaped aneurysm at the trification of the right middle cerebral artery but no finding of hematoma (Fig. 1). We decided emergency operation at once. When started the operation his both sides pupil dilated, B.P. was very low. OPERATION: Right side large frontolateral craniectomy was done. Large subdural hematoma (Fig. 2), severe diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fig. 3) and intracerebral hematoma were found.

In this paper we describe a 62-year-old female who underwent wide excision, axillary node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy for primary breast cancer.

She underwent simple mastectomy without systemic therapy. A chest X-ray 3 months later revealed diffuse bilateral lung metastases. The incidence of breast conserving therapies is growing fast. Until now we have no evidence on the role of irradiation as an aetiological reason for angiosarcoma after breast-conserving surgery and axillary node dissection. Therefore, we have to pay increasing attention to these patients. A patient with history of radiotherapy after breast conserving therapy and skin discolouration must undergo a biopsy of these areas. The only therapy of angiosarcoma is an early mastectomy. The success of chemotherapy is uncertain. Possibly adjuvant chemotherapy with actinomycin D for the group with poorly differentiated tumours appears beneficial. Prospective studies might help to resolve this question.", "label": 1}

The child is able to flex and extend his wrist, but this is limited by pain. A fractured midhumerus is suspected when the child has decreased sensation along his thumb and is unable to make the \"OK\" sign with his thumb and index finger.", "knowledge": "BACKGROUND: Compartment syndrome is often considered in patients with long-bone fractures and soft-tissue injuries, but is not as commonly associated with a period of unconsciousness.CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man was brought to our emergency department (ED) because he had lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time after snorting heroin. He had severe pain in his upper right arm. Physical examination revealed right arm edema, paresthesia, tenderness, and firmness to palpation. During the ED assessment, the patient began to experience pain in his right hip to a degree exceeding examination findings. We considered compartment syndrome affecting his upper arm as well as his gluteal muscles. The patient was taken to the operating room for fasciotomy. The triceps muscle was found to be bulging out of the compartment, demonstrating advanced compartment syndrome. A posterior approach to the hip allowed the gluteal sling and the fascia to be released, eliminating tension on the gluteus medius/minimus and gluteus maximus compartments. With physical therapy, the patient regained full flexion and extension in his arm at the elbow, partial extension of his wrist, and range of motion and strength in his hip.

He had severe pain in his upper right arm. Physical examination revealed right arm edema, paresthesia, tenderness, and firmness to palpation. During the ED assessment, the patient began to experience pain in his right hip to a degree exceeding examination findings. We considered compartment syndrome affecting his upper arm as well as his gluteal muscles. The patient was taken to the operating room for fasciotomy. The triceps muscle was found to be bulging out of the compartment, demonstrating advanced compartment syndrome. A posterior approach to the hip allowed the gluteal sling and the fascia to be released, eliminating tension on the gluteus medius/minimus and gluteus maximus compartments. With physical therapy, the patient regained full flexion and extension in his arm at the elbow, partial extension of his wrist, and range of motion and strength in his hip.

There were 5 electroneuromyography exams between 1989 and 2003 that revealed chronic reinnervation, some fasciculations (less than clinically observed) and rare fibrillation potentials, and slowly progressive sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) abnormality, leading to absent/low amplitude potentials. PCR techniques of DNA analysis showed an abnormal number of CAG repeats, found to be 44 (normal 11-34).

The disorder is caused by an abnormally expanded CGG repeat within the first exon of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene that is associated with shutdown of transcription and absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Detection of patients and carriers of the fragile X syndrome is done by DNA analysis of the CGG repeat, whereas the FMRP antibody test allows rapid detection of male patients using bloodsmears. In a screening program for the fragile X syndrome in the southwest of the Netherlands, 412 males with mental retardation of unknown cause were subjected to the protein test. The patients were scored for fragile X features and their DNA tested for the FMR1 mutation, as reported previously. The FMRP test detected two fragile X patients with a repeat expansion in FMR1, whereas normal protein expression was observed in all the retarded male patients with a normal repeat. The FMRP test was found to be suitable for screening among a large population of retarded males.

A pea-sized swelling was first noticed on the back of the left hand, which was gradual in onset and slowly progressed to its present size. The patient later noticed multiple swellings over his left leg and thigh, with a similar progression. There was no history suggestive of inflammatory changes or discharge from the lesions. There was no previous history of trauma. The patient was an asthmatic and was on long-term oral steroid therapy (10-20 mg/day prednisolone). None of his family members had similar complaints. On physical examination, the patient was febrile. Cutaneous examination showed multiple, circumscribed, lobulated, non-tender, mobile, cystic swellings of various sizes, ranging from less than 2 cm over the left shin to more than 8 cm over the dorsum of the left hand and ankle (Fig. 1a,b). The surface over these swellings was shiny, smooth, and intact. The skin over the swellings was pliable and normal in color. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, except for decreased breath sounds over the left mid and lower pulmonary lobes. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count and liver and renal function tests, were within normal limits. Random blood glucose was greater than 400 mg%. Histopathologic examination of one of the cysts (from the hand) showed pheohyphomycotic cysts lined by dense fibrous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate admixed with scattered giant cells in the dermis (Fig. 2). No fungal elements were visualized in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The fungal elements were found within the cystic cavity on special staining with Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) and Masson-Fontana stains. The hyphae had irregularly placed branches and showed constrictions around their septae, thus resembling pseudohyphae and yeast forms (Fig. 3). Fine needle aspiration cytology from one of the swellings showed the presence of filamentous fungi on KOH examination and brown-pigmented distorted filaments and yeast-like cells on Masson-Fontana staining (Fig. 4a,b). The positive Masson-Fontana stain was indicative of the presence of melanin in the fungal hyphae, even when the fungal hyphae were not pigmented in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained section. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent also stained the fungal elements, thus confirming our diagnosis of pheohyphomycosis and ruling out the possibility of hyalohyphomycosis. The culture for fungus from the swelling aspirate grew contaminants. The chest X-ray showed dense nodular shadows in the left lower and mid pulmonary lobes. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and Mantoux test were negative. During the hospital stay, the patient developed high fever and showed altered behavior, for which a computed tomography scan of the brain was performed; this showed evidence of multiple ring enhancing lesions in both frontal lobes. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. On the basis of the above findings, a diagnosis of disseminated subcutaneous pheohyphomycosis was made. The patient was given itraconazole, 100 mg twice daily, and his diabetes was managed with insulin. The fever stopped within a week and the altered behavior also started to show an improvement. There was obvious improvement in neurologic signs and symptoms. His skin lesions, however, responded slowly to the treatment.

", "knowledge": "A woman of 58 came for psychotherapy for the first time suffering from a depressive reaction precipitated by two mid-life events: the marriage of her daughter and the realization that her own cherished marital dream would never be fulfilled. She had postponed coming to terms with the disappointments of her marriage as long as she had had other objects. When these objects were lost, and the distance she had maintained to handle her feelings was threatened, she sought help. There was suggestive evidence that a collusive marital system had sustained an unsatisfactory relationship for 35 years. Her husband was described as an obsessive-compulsive character. His traits were both needed, feared, and resented by the patient, representing the rejected part of herself and aspects of her hated grandmother. Mrs. A. had character traits and a developmental history which supported a diagnosis of primitive hysterical personality. (This type has been described by Zetzel (1968) as \"the so-called good hysteric.\") The paucity of object relationships in her life, her poor work habits, her inability to tolerate affects were striking. The patient had identified with a pathological mother in a family dominated by rejecting and depreciating attitudes. The patient's use of the defense mechanisms of splitting, projection, and withdrawal as ways of dealing with ambivalence significantly interfered with her self-object differentiation and her capacity for intense emotional or physical intimacy. She could only love men whom she rescued or protected, a pattern consistent with the fact that she could not relate to equals or superiors. Yet she was unable to draw on a good identification with a nuturing mother, so as to really be able to give. There was too much hurt and uncontrolled anger when she was in the superior position with the kind of man who could not meet her dependency needs. Feeling unprotected, she had married a \"strong\" man, who she expected would meet her narcissistic and dependency demands. He was inhibited and controlled and could neither need nor be needed by her during his active work life. This led to immediate disappointment of her conflicting conscious and unconscious expectations. She wanted him to be strong and ideal, yet to need her and never oppose her. Hence, there was a failure to establish a mature or satisfying marital relationship. She turned to her children for comfort, particularly her daughter, becoming depressed when her daughter married. She found gratification by staying busy tutoring and teaching underprivileged children. In the course of treatment her depressive symptoms disappeared. She felt hopeful, capable of being believed in, and able to cope as a result of the therapist's functioning as her uncritical ally. After she resumed living with her husband she began to acknowledge an ambivalence toward her cherished, confidante daughter and in some ways reversed her previous splitting of husband and daughter. The mean husband became a kindly saint and the darling daughter became a critical, spiteful queen...", "label": 1}

Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an inability to recall important autobiographical information. Dissociative amnesia in the bereaved who have lost a loved one to cancer has not been previously reported. We discuss herein the case of a patient who developed dissociative amnesia the day after the death of here beloved husband.METHOD: A 38-year-old woman was referred for psychiatric consultation because of restlessness and abnormal behavior. Her 44-year-old husband had died of pancreatic cancer the day before the consultation. On the day of the death, she looked upset and began to hyperventilate. The next day, she behaved as if the deceased were still alive, which embarrassed her family. At her initial psychiatric consultation, she talked and behaved as if her husband was still alive and in the hospital.RESULTS: Her psychiatric features fulfilled the DSM-V criteria for dissociative amnesia. The death of her husband had been very traumatic for her and was considered to have been one of the causes of this dissociation.SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This report adds to the list of psychiatric symptoms in the bereaved who have lost a loved one to cancer. In an oncology setting, we should consider the impact of death, the concomitant defense mechanisms, and the background of the families.", "label": 0}

She was 154cm tall, weighing 62kg with so-called acromegalic facies. There were two lumps, one of which was on her right lateral forehead. The other on the right lower extremity seemed to be due to a bone deformity. Some brown pigmented macules with irregular borders were present on her lips and oral mucosa. Endocrine examination revealed elevated basal levels of plasma GH (54ng/ml) and PRL (36.2ng/ml), which paradoxically increased after injection of TRH. Plasma levels of these hormones did not change after LHRH test, and plasma GH level increased after GHRH test. A skull X-ray film showed a double floor of the sella turcia and hyperostotic formation of the right sphenoid bone. MRI and CT showed a tumor shadow in the right sella turcica. Bone roentogenography of the right fibula and tibia showed a large centrally expanding lesion with a ground-glass or cystic appearance and a thin cortex. The left fibula showed a similar lesion. We recognized similar findings in other bones which also showed abnormal accumulation in a radionuclide bone scan with 99mTc. On the basis of physical, endocrinological and roentogenographical examination, we diagnosed her as displaying McCune-Albright syndrome. We operated on her by transsphenoidal surgery and confirmed a functioning chromophobe adenoma which was removed during surgery. She has been free of GH and PRL hypersecretion since then. The pathology of the sphenoidal sinus affected with fibrous bone was in accordance with the findings of fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome (MCAS) is known as a syndrome characterized by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and cutaneous pigmentation and multiple endocrinopathy. Its etiology is unknown. This syndrome with acromegaly is rare, and although 26 cases have been described in literature, pathological examinations have been undertaken in only three cases. This case was very rare and valuable because, by operating on her by the transsphenoidal route in spite of the sphenoidal sinus being affected with fibrous bone, we were able to confirm a chromophobe adenoma secreting both GH and PRL. We recognized that acromegaly with MCAS was endocrinologically, morphologically and immunohistologically the same as acromegaly without MCAS.

She had a recent episode where she could not stop tapping a red paper, because if she stopped, she said it would burst into flame. During the 2 weeks before the pediatric visit, symptoms increased to the point that she is now refusing to go to school. When she stays home, she lays in 1 place all day.Chloe is a fourth grade student. The family does not report academic concerns. She has friends. She denies any appetite or sleep problems. She endorses periods of sadness, lack of energy, and decreased interest in social activities, mostly because she worries and is embarrassed. She kept her behaviors hidden from her 5 siblings for the past year, and she talked only to her mother about them. She is worried her friends might discover her behaviors.The family history is notable for multiple paternal family members with anxiety and bipolar disorder and depression on mother's side.

On examination, she was tachycardic (pulse rate 124\u200abeats/min) and hypertensive (blood pressure 142/88\u200amm Hg). There was marked tenderness and guarding at the lower abdomen.DIAGNOSES: Blood investigations were unremarkable, while abdominal ultrasonography found a live twin gestation with foetal heartbeats of 185 and 180\u200abeats/min. MRI of the abdomen revealed an empty uterine cavity; 2 amniotic sacs and fetuses of diameter 10\u200acm, and a single placenta were noted in the right uterine adnexa. The patient was diagnosed with right live monochorionic diamniotic twin tubal pregnancy.INTERVENTION: Our patient underwent emergency laparoscopic right salpingectomy.OUTCOMES: The operation was successful and her postoperative care remained uneventful up to discharge.LESSONS: Ectopic pregnancy cannot be ruled out based on prior normal antenatal examinations and gestational age of >10 weeks. EPs should not hesitate to order MRI scans for further evaluation if ultrasonography and laboratory findings are equivocal.", "label": 1}

The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation. His mother is concerned that he is developing \"tolerance\" to the regimen and wants to wean him off some of the medications. His mother is struggling to take care of the patient given his worsening behavior and body habitus (body mass index >99%; z = 3.41).There is a family history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism. He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications.He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose. During his psychiatric hospital stay, care coordination succeeded in arranging center-based applied behavior analysis interventions and respite care and parent training for his family. Sam began to show improvement in his overall agitation and aggression, requiring less clonazepam, and his mother then maintained outpatient follow-up.The day before discharge, you visit him in the hospital, and a medical student asks you why he was in the hospital for so long.

An 11-year-old girl came to our department with a 2-month history of diffuse hair loss on the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area (Figure 1). She had originally been examined by a pediatrician with the diagnosis of alopecia areata. The patient`s personal history included hay fever and shortsightedness, and she suffered from varicella and mononucleosis. Nobody in the family history suffered from alopecia areata, but her father has male androgenetic alopecia (Norwood/Hamilton MAGA C3F3). The mother noticed that the child had had changeable mood for about 2 months and did not want to communicate with other persons in the family. The family did not have any pet at home. At school, her favorite subjects were Math and Computer Studies. She did not like Physical Education and did not participate in any sport activities during her free time. This was very strange because she was obese (body-mass index (BMI) 24.69). She was sometimes angry with her 13-year-old sister who had better results at school. The girl had suddenly started to wear a blue scarf. The parents did not notice that she pulled out her hair at home. Dermatological examination of the capillitium found a zone of incomplete alopecia in the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area, without inflammation, desquamation, and scaring. Hairs were of variable length (Figure 1). There was a patch of incomplete alopecia above the forehead between two stripes of hair of variable length (Figure 2). The hair pull test was negative along the edges of the alopecia. Mycological examination from the skin capillitium was negative. The trichoscopy and skin biopsy of the parietotemporal region of the capillitium (Figure 3) confirmed trichotillomania. Laboratory tests (blood count, iron, ferritin, transferrin, selenium, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, serology and hormones of thyroid gland) were negative. We referred the girl for ophthalmologic and psychological examination. Ophthalmologic examination proved that there was no need to add any more diopters. The psychological examination provided us with a picture in which she drew her family (Figure 4). The strongest authority in the family was the mother because she looked after the girls for most of the day. She was in the first place in the picture. The father had longer working hours and spent more time outside the home. He worked as a long vehicle driver. He was in the second place in the picture. There was sibling rivalry between the girls, but the parents did not notice this problem and preferred the older daughter. She was successful at school and was prettier (slim, higher, curly brown hair, without spectacles). Our 11-years-old patient noticed all these differences between them, but at her level of mental development was not able to cope with this problem. She wanted to be her sister's equal. The sister is drawn in the picture in the third place next to father, while the patient's own figure was drawn larger and slim even though she was obese. Notably, all three female figures had very nice long brown hair. It seemed that the mother and our patient had better quality of hair and more intense color than the sister in the drawing. The only hairless person in the picture was the father. The girl did not want to talk about her problems and feelings at home. Then it was confirmed that our patient was very sensitive, anxious, willful, and withdrawn. She was interested in her body and very perceptive of her physical appearance. From the psychological point of view, the parents started to pay more interest to their younger daughter and tried to understand and help her. After consultation with the psychiatrist, we did not start psychopharmacologic therapy for trichotillomania; instead, we started treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, mild shampoo, mild topical steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%) in solution and methionine in capsules. With parents' cooperation, the treatment was successful. The name trichotillomania was first employed by the French dermatologist Francois Henri Hallopeau in 1889, who described a young man pulling his hair out in tufts (3-5). The word is derived from the Greek thrix (hair), tillein (to pull), and mania (madness) (5). The prevalence of TTM in the general adult population ranges from 0.6% to 4%, and 2-4% of the general psychiatric outpatient population meet the criteria for TTM (2-5). The prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at less than 1% (5). The disease can occur at any age and in any sex. The age of onset of hair pulling is significantly later for men than for women (3). There are three subsets of age: preschool children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. The mean age of onset is pre-pubertal. It ranges from 8 to 13 years (on average 11.3 years) (2-5). The occurrence of hair-pulling in the first year of life is a rare event, probably comprising <1% of cases (5). The etiology of TTM is complex and may be triggered by a psychosocial stressor within the family, such as separation from an attachment figure, hospitalization of the child or parent, birth of a younger sibling, sibling rivalry, moving to a new house, or problems with school performance. It has been hypothesized that the habit may begin with \"playing\" with the hair, with later chronic pulling resulting in obvious hair loss (2). Environment is a factor because children usually pull their hair when alone and in relaxed surroundings. The bedroom, bathroom, or family room are \"high-risk\" situations for hair-pulling (5). Men and women also differed in terms of the hair pulling site (men pull hair from the stomach/back and the moustache/beard areas, while women pull from the scalp) (3). Pulling hair from siblings, pets, dolls, and stuffed animals has also been documented, often occurring in the same pattern as in the patient (5). Genetic factors contributing to the development of TTM are mutations of the SLITRK1 gene, which plays a role in cortex development and neuronal growth. The protein SAPAP3 has been present in 4.2% of TTM cases and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be involved in the development of the spectrum of OCD. A significantly different concordance rate for TTM was found in monozygotic (38.1%) compared with dizygotic (0%) twins in 34 pairs (3). The core diagnostic feature is the repetitive pulling of hairs from one`s own body, resulting in hair loss. The targeted hair is mostly on the scalp (75%), but may also be from the eyebrows (42%), eyelashes (53%), beard (10%), and pubic area (17%) (3,5). There are three subtypes of hair pulling - early onset, automatic, and focused. Diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV criteria are (2,3,5): 1) recurrent pulling of one`s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss; 2) an increasing sense of tension immediately prior to pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior; 3) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair; 4) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g., a dermatologic condition); 5) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The differential diagnosis includes alopecia areata (Table 1) (6), tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, secondary syphilis, traction alopecia, loose anagen syndrome, lichen planopilaris, alopecia mucinosa, and scleroderma (2-5). Biopsy of an involved area (ideally from a recent site of hair loss) can help to confirm the diagnosis (5). On histologic examination, there are typically increased numbers of catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation. Chronic hair pulling induces a catagen phase, and more hairs will be telogen hairs. Pigment casts and empty anagen follicles are often seen. Perifollicular hemorrhage near the hair bulb is an indicator of TTM (2). Complications of TTM are rare, but they comprise secondary bacterial infections with regional lymphadenopathy as a result of picking and scratching at the scalp. Many patients play with and ingest the pulled hairs (e.g. touching the hair to lips, biting, and chewing). Trichophagia (ingestion of the hair) can lead to a rare complication named trichobezoar (a \"hair ball\" in stomach). This habit is present in approximately 5% to 30% of adult patients, but it is less frequent in children. Patient with trichophagia present with pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Radiologic examination and gastroscopy should not be delayed (2,4,5). The management of the disease is difficult and requires strong cooperation between the physician, patient, and parents. The dermatologist cannot take part in the therapy, strictly speaking, but without the psychological, psychopharmacologic, and topic dermatologic treatment a vicious circle will be perpetuated.

Chest radiograph revealed multiple bilateral ill-defined pulmonary nodules confirmed by computerized tomography. The patient underwent dilation and curettage productive of a moderate amount of tissue. The patient continued to have positive serum beta-HCGs and was given the presumptive diagnosis of FIGO stage III gestational choriocarcinoma. Because of the lack of intravenous chemotherapeutic agents, the patient was begun on methotrexate 0.40 mg/kg orally on days 1-5, with 9 days off. The patient completed one course of chemotherapy, followed by an interval total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient had a complete response to therapy and was treated with oral methotrexate for 2 courses after a negative serum beta-HCG. The patient tolerated the chemotherapy without any complication.CONCLUSION: Methotrexate is routinely used in a parenteral intramuscular fashion for the treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma. Physicians should be aware that, in very limited situations, oral methotrexate in combination with hysterectomy still could offer a patient successful treatment for stage III GTN.", "label": 0}

He was apparently well, except for left Bell's palsy which developed on May 9 of 1994, for which he received stellate ganglion block on the left side more than ten times until July 2nd of 1994, when he noted pain in his left shoulder and in his lumbar region. On July 5th, he noted some difficulty in urination. On July 6th, he noted tingling sensation in his four extremities and difficulty in gait. He was admitted to another hospital where he was treated with intravenous infusion of glycerol. After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar. He was transferred to our hospital on July 14th. His past medical history revealed that he had suffered from frequent bouts of osteomyelitis since the age of 13 years. He was operated on several times on osteomyelitis. He had been treated on his tooth ache until shortly before the onset of the present illness. He also received steroid hormone for his Bell's palsy. On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 34 cells/microliter (approximately two thirds were neutrophils), RBC 1,110/microliter, 2,949 mg/dl of protein, and 119 mg/dl of glucose; stapylococcus aureus was cultured from the CSF. Myelogram showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space between the low thoracic and the upper lumbar region. The patient was treated with cephotaxim, aminobenzyl penicillin, and chloramphenicol. On the second hospital day, his BT was still 39 degrees C and he was agitated His weakness was worse than the previous day. Spinal MRI was attempted; as he was agitated 5 mg of diazepam was given intravenously at 4 PM. His respiration was rapid and somewhat shallow. At 6 PM, gadolinium DTPA was injected intravenously; at that time, he was breathing and pupils were 3 mm on both sides. At 6:35 PM, an examiner noted that he stopped breathing; the left pupil was dilated to 5 mm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately, and intubation was performed. He was placed on a respirator. His blood pressure did not reach 100 mmHg; he was in deep coma. Cardiac arrest occurred at 8:53 AM on the next morning. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC. Most of the participants thought that the patient had either spinal epidural empyema or spinal subdural abscess. The question was what might be the original focus of infection.

SAPHO syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by specific clinical manifestations of synovitis, acne pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. It is a disease that manifests with a combination of osseous and articular manifestations associated with skin lesions (2). Venous thrombosis complicating SAPHO syndrome seems to be uncommon with an unclear pathogenesis (3-9). Coexistence of antiphospholipid syndrome and SAPHO syndrome was not previously mentioned in literature. A 33-year-old white woman was diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome at the age of 31. The patient was previously diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and depressive syndrome. She was treated with sulfasalazin (2 g daily) and methotrexate (20 mg weekly). Seven months before admission to our department she experienced an episode of deep vein thrombosis of the left leg, successfully treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium (40 mg daily) that was continued for the following 6 months as secondary prophylaxis. Pustular skin changes on palmar surface of the hands and plantar surface of the feet (characteristic for palmo-plantar pustulosis), tenderness of sterno-clavicular joints, swelling and restricted motion of both wrists, and pain on motion in both elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles were found on physical examination. There was also a moderate amount of effusion in her left knee. There was a 3-centimeter difference between the circumferences of the shins. The level of C reactive protein was increased (6.21 mg/L). The patient was positive for anti2glicoprotein-1 (anti-2G-1) antibodies. Tests for anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), antiannexin V antibodies, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies (aPS), and antiprothrombin antibodies (aPT) were negative. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer level were normal, and lupus anticoagulant was not present. Serum concentrations of protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, and antiprothrombin III levels were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and HLA-27 antigen were negative. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was 360 pg/mL, serum epidermal growth factor (EGF) level was 566 pg/mL. Bacteria culture of discharge from pustules was negative. Doppler ultrasound examination of the left leg confirmed thrombosis of one the posterior tibial veins at its lower third. Subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium was started and later replaced with acenocumarol. The dose of sulfasalazin was increased to 3.0 g daily, and azithromycin 1.0 g daily once a week (for 8 weeks) was added. After 3 months, the patient reported reduction of joint pain. The follow-up Doppler ultrasound examination of the left leg revealed resolution of thrombosis. Three months later, the anti-2G-1 antibodies were positive, so the patient met the criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome (1). The treatment with acenocumarol was continued and hydroxychlorochine was started. Venous thrombosis complicating SAPHO syndrome seems to be uncommon with an unclear pathogenesis. There were reports of thrombosis of the following veins: subclavian, mediastinan, iliac, and the superior vena cava (3-8). We have diagnosed recurrent tibial vein thrombosis in a patient with SAPHO syndrome in the course of antiphospholipid syndrome. There were suggestions that the reason for some cases of vein thrombosis in SAPHO syndrome is a pressure of the hyperostotic skeleton or inflamed soft tissue on the vein walls (3,4,6,10), which was not the case in our patient. Legoupil et al. (6) suggested that the reason for iliac vein thrombosis in SAPHO syndrome was an impressive extension of the inflammatory process to the soft tissues within the lumbar spine. That patient was negative for aCL antibodies (6). Kawabata et al. (7) suspected that aCL antibodies could be the reason for thrombosis in this syndrome, but the patient with multiple venous thrombosis presented in his case report was negative for aCL antibodies; however, he was not tested for anti-2G-1 antibodies. There was a paper demonstrating increased level of aCL antibodies in 5 of 12 patients with SAPHO syndrome (11). In our observations of 17 patients with SAPHO syndrome, only 1 had increased level of aCL antibodies without symptoms of thrombosis (12). That patient was negative for aCL antibodies, aPT antibodies, aPS antibodies, and antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, but she was positive twice for anti-2G-1 antibodies. The presence of anti-2G-1antibodies may be caused by an infectious agent, but in our case bacteria culture of the discharge from pustules was negative. One year after the first episode of deep vein thrombosis, our patient met the criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome. We conclude that antiphospholipid syndrome, especially the presence of anti-2G-1 antibodies, could be the cause of increased risk of vein thrombosis in SAPHO syndrome.", "label": 1}

She denied fevers, chills, night sweats or cough. Her symptoms were unresponsive to a course of oral dicloxacillin. The neck mass enlarged over 8 weeks and she was referred to our institution for evaluation. CT scan of the neck showed an enlarged lymph node. Ten days prior to her presentation in dermatology, a fine needle aspirate of the enlarging lymph node revealed necrotizing granulomas. Tissue was sent for routine mycobacterial and fungal cultures. Routine blood work, chest radiograph, and a tuberculin skin test were also performed. At the time of her dermatology visit she described the development of multiple new painful, non-pruritic lesions, bilaterally on the lower extremities. She also reported a red crusted area that appeared at the site of her tuberculin test that was placed subsequent to the development of her lower extremity lesions.

He was previously followed by a psychiatrist for 2 years for additional diagnoses of insomnia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability. He has tried and (apparently) failed multiple psychotropic trials including stimulants, nonstimulants, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. He has a delayed sleep onset and frequent night awakenings each night for the past 3 months, during which he \"screams, cries, and thrashes and can stay up for over an hour.\" His behaviors are described as irritable, self-injurious, and aggressive with no clear pattern of triggers according to his mother. He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation. His mother is concerned that he is developing \"tolerance\" to the regimen and wants to wean him off some of the medications. His mother is struggling to take care of the patient given his worsening behavior and body habitus (body mass index >99%; z = 3.41).There is a family history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism. He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home.

He has a delayed sleep onset and frequent night awakenings each night for the past 3 months, during which he \"screams, cries, and thrashes and can stay up for over an hour.\" His behaviors are described as irritable, self-injurious, and aggressive with no clear pattern of triggers according to his mother. He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation.

", "knowledge": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to rescue a neonate with severe low cardiac output syndrome following open heart surgery.METHODS: The patient was a male, 2 d, 2.8 kg, G3P2 full-term neonate with gestational age 40 weeks, born by Cesarean-section with Apgar score of 10 at 1 min. He was admitted due to severe dyspnea with oxygen desaturation and heart murmur on the second day after birth. Physical examination showed clear consciousness, cyanosis, dyspnea, RR 70 bpm and a grade II/6 heart murmur. Bp was 56/45 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) and SpO2 around 65%. Blood WBC 13.1 x 10(9)/L, N 46.1%, Hb 238 g/L, Plt 283 x 10(9)/L, CRP < 1 mg/L. Echocardiographic findings: TGA + ASD + PDA with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. After supportive care and prostaglandin E1 (5 ng/kg/min) treatment, his condition became stable with SpO2 85 - 90%. On the 6(th) day of life, the baby underwent an arterial switch procedure + ASD closing and PDA ligation. The time of aorta clamp was 72 mins. The cool 4:1 blood cardioplegia was given for 2 times during aortal clamp. Ultrafiltration was used. The internal and external volumes were almost equal and the electrolytes and blood gas and hematocrit (36%) were normal during extracorporeal bypass. Due to a failure (severe low cardiac output) to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (263 min) with acidosis (lactate 8.8 mmol/L), low blood pressure (< 39/30 mm Hg), increased LAP (> 20 mmHg), bloody phlegm, decreased urine output [< 1 ml/(kg.h)], a V-A ECMO was used for cardio-pulmonary support. ECMO setup: Medtronic pediatric ECMO package (CB2503R1), carmeda membrane oxygenator and centrifugal pump (bio-console 560) were chosen. Direct cannulation of the ascending aorta (Edward FEM008A) and right atrium (TF018090) was performed using techniques that were standard for cardiopulmanory bypass. The ECMO system was primed with 400 ml blood, 5% CaCl(2)1g, 5% sodium bicarbonate 1.5 g, 20% mannitol 2 g, albumin 10 g, and heparin 5 mg. The blood was re-circulated until the temperature was 37 degrees C and blood gases and the electrolytes were in normal range. The patient was weaned from bypass and connected to V-A ECMO. Management of ECMO: the blood flow was set at 150 - 200 ml/kg/min. Venous saturation (SvO2) was maintained at the desired level (75%) by increasing and decreasing extracorporeal blood flow. Systemic blood pressure was maintained at 76/55 - 80/59 mm Hg by adjusting blood volume. Hemoglobin was maintained between 120 - 130 g/L. Platelet count was maintained at > 75,000/mm3 and ACT was maintained at 120 - 190 s. The mechanical ventilation was reduced to lung rest settings (FiO2 35%, RR 10 bpm, PIP 16 cm H(2)O, PEEP 5 cm H2O) to prevent alveolar collapse. Inotropic drug dosages were kept at a low level.RESULTS: The patient was successfully weaned from ECMO following 87 hours treatment. LVEF on day 1, 2 and 3 following ECMO were 20%, 34% and 43% respectively. The circulation was stable after weaning from ECMO with Bp 75/55 mm Hg, HR 160 bpm and LAP 11 mm Hg under inotropic drug suppor with epinephrine [(0.2 microg/(kg.min)], dopamine [(8 microg/(kg.min)], milrinone [(0.56 microg/(kg.min)]. The blood gases after 1 h off-ECMO showed: pH 7.39, PaO2 104 mm Hg, PaCO2 45 mm Hg, lactate 3.8 mmol/L, Hct 35%, K(+) 3.8 mmol/L, Ca(++) 1.31 mmol/L. The serum lactate was normal after 24 h off-ECMO. On day 22 off-ECMO, the baby was successfully extubated and weaned from conventional ventilator. On day 58, the patient was discharged. Serial ultrasound imaging studies revealed no cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage during and after ECMO. At the time of hospital discharge, the patient demonstrated clear consciousness with good activity, normal function of heart, lung, liver and kidney. However, more subtle morbidities, such as behavior problems, learning disabilities should be observed ria long term follow-up. The main ECMO complications were pulmonary hemorrhage, bleeding on the sternal wound, tamponade, hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia.CONCLUSION: ECMO is an effective option of cardio-pulmonary support for neonate with low cardiac output syndrome following open heart surgery.", "label": 0}

During the first few days of life, he developed mild respiratory distress; a chest radiograph and computed tomography scan showed multiple cystic areas in the left lower lobe with hyperinflation and herniation of the upper lobe across the midline. At 3 weeks of age, a left lower lobectomy was performed for presumed cystic malformation. To our surprise the pathology reports revealed pulmonary interstitial emphysema. The postoperative chest radiograph was unchanged, and mechanical ventilation was necessary and required progressively increasing ventilatory settings to provide adequate support. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation and selective right bronchus intubation failed to improve lung function. After 3 weeks, a left thoracotomy was repeated and lung volume reduction was performed with removal of 50' of the peripheral hyperinflated parenchyma. Postoperative recovery was rapid; the child was weaned from the ventilator after 3 days and discharged after 3 weeks. Follow-up chest X-rays showed a normally expanded right lung with mediastinal structures back to midline and a small left lung. Favorable results persisted at 3 years of follow-up. This first and successful experience with lung volume reduction in a neonate suggests that infants who need removal of a large portion of lung parenchyma to achieve adequate ventilation and gas exchange, lung volume reduction surgery should be considered as an alternative to pneumonectomy.", "label": 1}

Patient is diagnosed with posterior cord syndrome.", "knowledge": "We report a right-handed 62-year-old man with early onset familial parkinsonism. The patient was well until 24 years of the age when he noted an onset of resting tremor in his right hand. During the next four years, he noted rigidity, bradykinesia, and difficulty in walking. He was seen in another hospital at 28 years of the age, where he received left pallidotomy. Rigidity on the left side showed marked improvement. He received right pallidotomy at age 30 years. He developed right hemiplegia after this surgery. He was admitted to our hospital in March, 1983 when he was 51 years of the age. He was treated with levodopa but improvement was rather of minor degree. He was transferred to another hospital, but his motor disturbance progressed slowly, and was admitted again to our hospital in November 1990. He had 6 siblings 4 of whom including himself suffered from parkinsonism. No consanguinity was noted in parents. On admission, he appeared chronically ill but the general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed an alert and mentally sound man. Hasegawa dementia scale was 28.5/32.5. Upward gaze was slightly restricted (3/5). Cranial nerve examination revealed oculogyric crisis, apraxia of eyelid opening, masked face, and small voice. He was able to stand with support; his posture showed left-ward leaning. He had right hemiparesis with moderate weakness. He showed marked bradykinesia and moderate rigidity in his left upper extremity. Fine postural tremor was noted in the left hand. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished in the upper extremities. No Babinski sign was noted. Pain sensation was somewhat diminished on the right side. Results of routine laboratory examination were unremarkable. Cranial CT scan revealed atrophy in the frontal lobe, particularly in the prefrontal area. In addition, MRI revealed T1-and-T2-low signal intensity lesions in the right ventral pallidal region and in the left ventrolateral thalamic-hypothalamic areas. He was treated with 600 mg of levodopa with benserazide and 22.5 mg of bromocriptine with mild to moderate improvement in his bradykinesia and rigidity. He was discharged in January 1991. His clinical course was complicated by intestinal obstruction in October, 1994. He was admitted to another hospital where he was operated on the obstruction on November 5, 1994. The sigmoid colon was markedly dilated but no mass was found. Postoperative course was uneventful until November 18, 1994 when he was found dead in his hospital room shortly after 4 am. The patient was discussed in neurological CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had young-onset familial Lewy body-negative parkinsonism. Opinions were divided between Lewy body-positive familial Parkinson's disease and Lewy body negative young onset parkinsonism. Postmortem examination revealed aspiration pneumonia, which appeared to be the cause of his death, in the right lung. Neuropathologic examination revealed loss of malanized neurons in the substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus. In the substantia nigra, neuronal loss was particularly severe in the ventrolateral area. No Lewy bodies were seen. The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve was well preserved. Stereotaxic lesions involved bilateral thalamic areas. This patient appears to represent a case of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP). Early onset, superb response to levodopa, sleep effect, and easy development of dyskinesias and motor fluctuations characterize AR-JP. The reason why this patient did not show these clinical features is probably bilateral sterotaxic surgeries. Particularly, the second surgery was complicated by right hemiparesis. His siblings who developed parkinsonism showed typical clinical features of AR-JP.", "label": 0}

On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection.

He was treated with 600 mg of levodopa with carbidopa; his tremor partially improved. He received left Vim thalamotomy on March 14 of 1987. His tremor disappeared after the thalamotomy. Post-operative course was complicated by transient clouding of consciousness due to subdural hematoma which developed after the surgery. Six months after the surgery, he noted increase in the unsteadiness of gait; he also experienced urinary incontinence once in a while, and he became mentally dull. In November of 1988, he had episodes of stiffening of his body. Although his spontaneous speech was very much reduced, he repeatedly hummed a same tune; no one could make him stop humming. In June of 1989, he was totally unable to move his eyes in the vertical direction. He was hospitalized to another hospital in May of 1990 where he died six month after admission because of pneumonia. The clinical course of this patient was characterized by the onset with parkinsonian resting tremor, and supranuclear gaze palsy and dementia in the later course. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had an overlap syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and diffuse Lewy body disease. Majority of the participants thought that the patient had progressive supranuclear palsy, but many of them had an impression that parkinsonian tremor responding to levodopa as the initial symptom for PSP is rather unusual. Postmortem examination revealed severe loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, and the subthalamic nucleus with reactive gliosis; formy spheroids were seen in the substantia nigra, however, no Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles were observed. Moderate neuronal loss was also seen in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum.

His weakness had become progressively worse, and he became unable to walk in November of 1985. He noted dysarthria one month later, and dysphagia in March of 1986. His difficulty in swallowing had also become worse; he regurgitated foods into the trachea in September of that year, and he developed a low grade fever on the same day. He was admitted to our service on September 24, 1987. On physical examination, general findings were unremarkable, except for low grade fever (37.3 degrees C).

He had moderate weakness in facial muscles, dysarthria, dysphagia, and atrophy in his tongue. He had marked generalized muscle atrophy with fasciculation. He was unable to stand or walk. His muscle strength was not more than 1/6 in any part. The lower extremities were spastic. Deep reflexes were exaggerated in both lower extremities but were normal in upper extremities. Sensation was intact. Laboratory examination was unremarkable, and so was the cranial CT scan. He was treated with nasogastric feeding. He was able to communicate smoothly using his eyes, but a restriction in the vertical gaze was noted in February of 1989. The range of ocular movement was better in the oculocephalic reflex compared with his spontaneous vertical eye movements. In April of 1990, his horizontal gaze also had become slow, and he was complicated by bronchial asthma. He was treated with 20 mg/day of prednisolone; after the institution of prednisolone, his horizontal eye movement showed much improvement. In the terminal stage, he was able to move his eyes only very slowly; vertical gaze was impossible. His subsequent course was complicated by respiratory tract infection and septicemia, and he expired on July 15, 1992.

The patient was well until his age of 63 when he was found to have a gastric cancer. He was treated by the tumor resection and chemotherapy; he was apparently well, but hepatic metastases were found in the next year (1996). In June, 1996, he noted an onset of blurred vision more on the left. He was admitted to the ophthalmology service of our hospital on July 14, 1996. His vision was 0.8 on the right and 0.15 on the left. He was treated with oral prednisolone with slight improvement. He was also found to have IgM kappa-type monoclonal gammopathy; Bence-Jones protein was positive and a bone marrow aspiration revealed that approximately 10% of bone marrow cells were atypical plasma cells. His vision had progressively got worse and he became blind by the end of October 1996. A chest X-ray and cranial CT scan revealed multiple abnormal nodular densities. In the middle of November 1996, he became confused, disoriented and agitated. His mental symptoms had progressively became worse, and a neurologic consultation was asked on December 10, 1996. Neurologic examination revealed that he was somnolent with decreased attention to his surroundings. He showed marked disorientation and memory loss. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. He was able to recognize only light and dark. Pupils were moderately dilated with very sluggish light reflex remained. Vertical gaze was moderately restricted and horizontal nystagmus was noted upon left and right lateral gaze. The remaining of the neurologic examination were unremarkable. General physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly; the liver was palpable by 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory examination revealed anemia (Hb10.1 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (43,000/microliter). A cranial CT scan and MRI revealed a mass lesion in involving the chiasmatic and bilateral hypothalamic areas. The tumor showed intense homogeneous enhancement after Gd-DTPA infusion. The patient was treated with dexamethasone and radiation. After 9 Gray radiation, he showed deterioration in the sensorium; a cranial CT scan revealed a hydrocephalus of the right ventricle with the midline shift towards left. The radiation was discontinued. The subsequent clinical course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. He expired on January 4, 1997. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had systemic malignant lymphoma with metastasis to the brain judging from the characteristics of MRI and CT findings. Opinions were divided between malignant lymphoma and metastatic brain tumor. Post-mortem examination revealed plasmacytoid lymphocytic infiltration in the bone marrow. Immunologically, these cells were positive for IgM and kappa-type light chain. These plasmacytic infiltrations were seen in the lungs and lymph nodes. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Waldenstr?m's macroglobulinemia. In the liver metastatic cancer tissues were seen; microscopic pictures were essentially similar to those of resected gastric cancer. No local recidive was noted in the stomach. In the central nervous system, a necrotic tissue was involving the hypothalamic area bilaterally; no clear neoplastic cells were found, however, lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrations were seen in the perivascular space. In the optic nerves, loss of myelin and axons were seen. These findings most likely mass formation from macroglobulinemia which underwent necrotic change after radiation.

The pathogenesis is poorly understood. A 22-year-old man noticed a node growth a month before his admittance. At first he noticed one enlarged node in the left axilla, later also the nodes on his neck and in his right axilla. Before that he had felt shivery and reported night sweats. Physical examination revealed bilateral enlarged (up to 2 cm) painful but not inflamed lymph nodes on the neck and in both axillae. The patient was diagnosed with KFD on histological examination of the nodes and on the basis of typical changes. No medical treatment was prescribed and the patient has been without symptoms for the past two years. The clinical picture of KFD is nonspecific and variable. Most patients complain of enlarged cervical nodes (up to 2 cm) accompanied by various symptoms (fever, malaise, night sweats, weight loss). The enlarged nodes, which are mobile, rarely appear in other locations. The only way of proving whether the disease is present or not is by histological examination of the node, which may show the following changes typical for KFD: paracortical necrotic foci, surrounded by histiocytic aggregates, irregular rounded eosinophilic areas of different sizes in the paracortex and cortex with the presence of numerous histiocytes, lymphocytes, immunoblasts, plasmacytoid monocytes and eosinophilic granulated cellular debris. Histiocytes had mostly turned into foamy macrophages. It is typical not to find epithelioid cells and neutrophil granulocytes in the necrotic centers. In particular, the disease needs to be distinguished from high-grade lymphoma and SLE lymphadenitis. There is no specific medical treatment for KFD since the disease usually resolves spontaneously over four months. Disease recurrence or fatalities are unusual.", "label": 1}

Her food choices became increasingly restrictive to the point where she only ate certain types and brands of foods. She gradually stopped drinking and developed severe constipation and encopresis. A new behavior of collecting saliva in her mouth and spitting onto napkins also emerged. Vital signs and electrolytes were normal on admission. A nasogastric tube was placed because she refused to eat. A behavior modification plan was implemented that awarded points for completing specific tasks related to feeding, which could later be redeemed for specific rewards, such as computer time. Although her ideal body weight increased from 68% to 75% (due to continuous nasogastric tube feeds), her refusal to eat persisted. Upon further data gathering, the staff learned that she moved and changed schools 5 months ago. She was cared for by either a family friend or paid caregiver while her mother worked. Although she could conduct basic self-care activities without assistance and write and draw at a third-grade level, she functioned cognitively at a 4-year-old level. The behavior plan was modified, breaking the tasks into shorter components with immediate and tangible rewards. She soon began eating small portions of food and spitting less frequently. Toileting was later incorporated into this plan. She was referred to a behavioral therapist in the community to work with her at home and school.

His head remained in neutral position. Anesthesia was maintained with air, oxygen, sevoflurane, fentanyl, and vecuronium using mepivacaine via epidural catheter. During surgical procedures, he was in a combined lithotomy and head down position at maximum of 20 degrees. The operative table was tilted to the right at maximum of 20 degrees.

Her medications at admission included aripiprazole 30 mg p.o. daily, escitalopram 10 mg p.o. daily, and lamotrigine 75 mg p.o. daily. Lamotrigine was the only new medication, initiated four weeks before this admission. The dermatology service confirmed the diagnosis of SJS using punch biopsy. Lamotrigine was suspected to be the culprit and was discontinued immediately. The patient was given oral prednisone 40 mg and intravenous fluids. Hydroxyzine was given for pruritus, and petroleum jelly and viscous lidocaine were applied to her lips. On hospital day 2, her symptoms and dermatological manifestations improved, but she continued to complain about irritation and slight pain of the mouth. She then received a mouthwash consisting of diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and sodium bicarbonate. On hospital day 3, the patient had improved substantially and was discharged home. Reports of these dermatological reactions in patients receiving lamotrigine for the treatment of bipolar disorder are limited. Dosing, prompt recognition, and patient education are crucial for preventing morbidity and mortality associated with the development of serious cutaneous reactions.CONCLUSION: SJS was associated with lamotrigine use, despite appropriate dosing and dosage adjustment.", "label": 0}
