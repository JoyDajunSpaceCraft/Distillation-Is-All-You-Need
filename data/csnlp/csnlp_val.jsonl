Case investigations detected 3 cases with severe cutaneous injuries described in this article.CASES: There were 57 probable cases of box jellyfish stings between 2008 and 2013. Three of these injuries resulted in dermal necrosis, and 2 were associated with severe wound complications. A Thai man aged 21 years sustained wounds on his left knee and thigh. He received oral antibiotics and daily wet dressings; he did not receive steroids. He subsequently developed blisters, swelling of the lower left leg, neuritis, and severe itching in the later stages. Nevertheless, his wounds did not become infected and there was no keloid scarring. An American woman aged 25 years sustained stings on her right hand and arm. She received antibiotic ointment and a tape that was placed directly on the wound without any gauze or padding underneath. She developed a wound infection 2 weeks postinjury. Surgical debridement was required twice to remove necrotic tissue; keloid scars persisted on evaluation at 4 months. An American woman aged 33 years received stings on her left upper thigh. Initial treatment was provided by local residents, who crushed morning glory leaves to extract the juice and then applied the juice (mixed with water) to her wounds. She received intravenous steroids, oral antihistamines, oral analgesics, and antibiotic cream at the hospital. Despite this aggressive treatment, the wounds became gangrenous and surgical debridement was required to remove necrotic tissue.CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be knowledgeable regarding the potentially serious wounds that can develop following jellyfish stings. Additional research is needed to identify best management approaches.", "label": 1}

Case 1 was a 10-year-old boy visiting us because of pain and swelling in his right scrotum continuing for the past ten days. His right scrotum was found to contain a hen-egg sized tender mass. The testis and epididymis could not be differentiated by palpation. The blood count disclosed 10,000 white blood cells. At operation, two appendix epididymis were found in his right scrotum. One of them was twisted 360 degrees clockwise and 10 x 8 x 5 mm in size. Case 2 was a 11-year-old boy with complaint of pain in his left lower abdomen and left scrotum for the past three days. Palpation of his left scrotal contents revealed a slightly hard testis and tender epididymis. At operation, we found his left spermatic cord to be twisted 90 degrees counterclockwise and appendix epididymis 180 degrees counterclockwise. The twisted appendix epididymis was 10 x 8 x 7 mm in size. Case 3 was a 13-year-old boy whose complaint was left scrotal pain. The upper pole of his left testis was found to be swollen and tender by palpation. The exposure of his left scrotum at operation revealed that his left epididymis was abnormally attached to his left testis and had two appendices. One of these appendix epididymis was twisted 180 degrees clockwise and measured 10 x 10 x 8 mm. Case 4 was a 19-year-old male who suffered from right testicular pain for the past seven days.

We report a phosgene exposure that resulted in the patient's death.CASE REPORT: A 58 year-old man arrived to the emergency department 1 hour after exposure to phosgene with complaints of a sore throat. Initial vital signs were blood pressure 175/118 mmHg, heart rate 98/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Physical exam revealed few scattered rhonchi, without signs of distress. Initial arterial blood gases (ABG's) revealed pH 7.42, pCO2 43 mmHg, pO2 68 mmHg, HCO3 27 meq/L, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Initial chest x-ray 2 hours after the exposure demonstrated clear lung fields. Approximately 2.5 hours after the exposure, he began complaining of dyspnea, restlessness and his oxygen saturation dropped below 90%. He received nebulized albuterol, 1 gram intravenous methylprednisolone, and 100 % oxygen via face mask. Minimal improvement was noted and he was intubated. The post intubation chest x-ray, 3.5 hours after the exposure, revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Acetylcysteine, terbutaline, and IV steroids were administered without improvement. The patient died 30 hours after exposure.DISCUSSION: There are many misunderstandings concerning phosgene due to its rare presentation. Traditional treatment modalities are often unproven in human trials and were unsuccessful in this case.CONCLUSION: This case highlights the significant toxicity that results from phosgene exposure and the challenges of the limited treatment modalities. There is concern for the use of this agent in chemical terrorism.", "label": 0}

In adults, HSV type 1 is found predominantly in the oral area, and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) is commonly found in the genital area. HSV-2 infection without genital lesions is uncommon. Herein we report a unique case of pharyngotonsillitis as an initial manifestation of disseminated HSV-2 infection without genital involvement.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and sore throat. His past medical history included hypereosinophilic syndrome diagnosed at age 45\u2009years. Physical examination revealed throat congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy in the left posterior triangle, and mild epigastric tenderness. The laboratory data demonstrated bicytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear showed hypocellular marrow with histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The diagnosis of HLH was confirmed, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy on days 1-3. On day 5, despite initial improvement of the fever and sore throat, multiple, new, small bullae developed on the patient's face, trunk, and extremities. Additional testing showed that he was positive for HSV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Disseminated HSV infection was suspected, and intravenous acyclovir (10\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h) was begun. A subsequent direct antigen test of a bulla sample was positive for HSV-2. Moreover, tonsillar and esophageal biopsies revealed viral inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed the presence of HSV-2. Disseminated HSV-2 infection with multiple bullae, tonsillitis, esophagitis, and suspected hepatic involvement was diagnosed. After a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir, his hematological status and liver function normalized, and his cutaneous skin lesions resolved. He was discharged on day 22 in good general health and continued taking oral valacyclovir for viral suppression due to his immunosuppressed status.CONCLUSION: Disseminated HSV-2 infection should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and impaired liver function of unknown etiology even if there are no genital lesions.", "label": 0}

He worked as a ranger at Ken-Ting Farm in southern Taiwan, and had been to Thailand for sight-seeing 5 years ago. He came to our outpatient department about one month prior to hospitalization for intermittent fever of one week duration. At that time, complete blood count was within normal limits and a chest roentgenogram was unremarkable. He was given erythromycin without showing any clinical improvement. Two days prior to admission, he noted pain in the left hip. The next day, severe dyspnea developed suddenly and chest x-ray film revealed bilateral nodular lesions. Physical examination on hospitalization revealed an acutely ill and jaundiced male with a temperature of 37.4 degrees C, blood pressure: 110/47 mmHg, pulse rate: 137/min, and respiratory rate: 26/min. There were rales in both lungs, but no lymphadenopathy or organ enlargement. Laboratory study showed WBC: 1,470/mm(3), platelet count: 47,000/mm(3), blood sugar: 226 mg/dL, mildly elevated transaminases and bilirubin, and BUN: 69 mg/dL, Cr: 4.3 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated an acute metabolic acidosis with PaO2 of 32 mmHg. Despite the initial impression of melioidosis and administration of ceftazidime plus gentamicin, his condition rapidly deteriorated and expired 18 hours after admission. Two sets of blood cultures grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis has been called a great imitator of diseases and culture results are frequently misinterpreted. The mortality is high even with suggested therapy with ceftazidime, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, and/or tetracycline. There has been a total of 10 cases reported in southern Taiwan and 2 of them were clearly indigenous.

The S. bovis group has been recently reclassified and renamed as Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. We report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named S. bovis biotype I). A 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. Initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic valves. Antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. The infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. The strain was identified as S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the Vitek 2 GPI and API 20 Strep systems (bioM?rieux, USA). The 16S rDNA sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in GenBank. The identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer. The patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer.

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed vegetation of the mitral and the aortic valve. The presence of continuous bacteremia was confirmed by multiple sets of blood culture, whereby gram-positive cocci was retrieved and identified as Staphylococcus saprophyticus (S. saprophyticus) both phenotypically and genetically. Because two major criteria of the Modified Duke Criteria were met, the patient was diagnosed with native valve endocarditis due to S. saprophyticus. The urine culture was also positive for gram-positive cocci, phenotypically identified as Staphylococcus warneri, which was subsequently identified as S. saprophyticus with the use of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry), indicating strongly that the intermittent catheterization-associated urinary tract infection resulted in bacteremia that eventually lead to infective endocarditis. This patient was treated with vancomycin and clindamycin. Because of multiple cerebral infarctions, the patient underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement on hospital day 5. Blood culture turned negative at 6th hospital day. Antibiotic therapy was continued for six weeks after surgery. The patient's clinical course was uneventful thereafter, and was discharged home.

We aimed to establish a baseline of knowledge regarding the prevalence of MRSA in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well as S. aureus antimicrobial susceptibility to current available antimicrobials, while also determining those most effective to treat S. aureus infections.METHODS: Samples were collected from patients at two main Health facilities in Kabul between September 2016 and February 2017. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by the disc diffusion method and studied using standard CLSI protocols.RESULTS: Out of 105 strains of S. aureus isolated from pus, urine, tracheal secretions, and blood, almost half (46; 43.8%) were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) while 59 (56.2%) were Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All strains were susceptible to vancomycin. In total, 100 (95.2%) strains were susceptible to rifampicin, 96 (91.4%) susceptible to clindamycin, 94 (89.5%) susceptible to imipenem, 83 (79.0%) susceptible to gentamicin, 81(77.1%) susceptible to doxycycline, 77 (77.1%) susceptible to amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid, 78 (74.3%) susceptible to cefazolin, 71 (67.6%) susceptible to tobramycin, 68 (64.8%) susceptible to chloramphenicol, 60 (57.1%) were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 47 (44.8%) susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 38 (36.2%) susceptible to azithromycin and erythromycin, 37 (35.2%) susceptible to ceftriaxone and 11 (10.5%) were susceptible to cefixim. Almost all (104; 99.05%) were resistant to penicillin G and only 1 (0.95%) was intermediate to penicillin G. Interestingly, 74.6% of MRSA strains were azithromycin resistant with 8.5% of them clindamycin resistant. Ninety-six (91.4%) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant.CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of Methicillin resistance (56.2%) among S. aureus strains in the samples collected and most (91.4%) were multidrug resistant. The most effective antibiotics to treat Staph infections were vancomycin, rifampicin, imipenem, clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefazolin, gentamicin and doxycycline. The least effective were azithromycin, ceftriaxone, cefixim and penicillin. We recommend that, where possible, in every case of S. aureus infection in Kabul, Afghanistan, Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) should be performed and responsible use of antibiotics should be considered.", "label": 1}

Neuropsychological tests demonstrated impairment of recent memory and calculation. Pleocytosis (83/microl) and increase of protein (1269 mg/dl) and IgG (141 mg/dl) in the CSF were observed. Brain MRI showed multiple nodular lesions with high intense signal on T2-weighted images and Gd-DTPA enhancement on T1-weighted images. Chest CT showed multiple nodular lesions in the bilateral lungs. The needle lung biopsy was performed, which showed infiltration of lymphocytes around the vessels. An immunohistochemical study showed that the infiltrating cells were mainly CD8 positive T lymphocytes. B lymphocyte and plasma cells were not seen. The histological findings excluded intravascular malignant lymphoma and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Therefore we diagnosed lymphoid vasculitis. The patient developed pancytopenia caused by hemophagocytic syndrome 48 days after admission and was treated with 1 g of methylprednisolone per day for 3 days and a tapered dose of steroid (500 mg to 125 mg of methylprednisolone and 60 mg to 10mg of predonisolone) for 21 days, which resulted in the improvement of clinical features (hemophagocytic syndrome and central nervous system symptoms) and the abnormal CSF findings.

The patient refused biopsies at this visit. Given the patient's previous diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, it was thought that the skin lesions might represent ulcerative cutaneous sarcoidosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum was also considered to be a likely diagnosis.

His temperature is 39 C (102.2 F) and blood pressure is 105/68 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. An MRI of the brain shows asymmetrical, bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows:\nLeukocyte count 120/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 10%\nLymphocytes 90%\nErythrocyte count 15/mm3\nGlucose 45 mg/dL\nOpening pressure 130 mm Hg\nProtein 75 mg/dL\nThe patient is infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus.", "knowledge": "A 41-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man was hospitalized with complaints of a 4-week history of nausea and vomiting, associated with decreased oral intake, and a 4-day history of frontal headache and fever. His medical history was significant for a gunshot wound to the head 3 years prior, with a residual seizure disorder. He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 50/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days). Nine days later, ivermectin (4.5 mg once daily for 3 days for 2 courses) was also added. He continued to clinically deteriorate. The patient died 31 days after systemic antihelminthic treatment was initiated.", "label": 1}
