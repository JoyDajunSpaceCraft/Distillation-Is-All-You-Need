We compared the results of twins and the other newborn (non-twins). The examinations were performed by 19 physicians. 73 (2%) of the newborn were twins (29 male, 44 female).RESULTS: In the group of 3666 non-twins we found the types of hip IIa (alpha < 55 degrees) to IV (Graf's classification) in 237 (6.5%) newborn: 136 (3.7%) right side/183 (5.0%) left side. Only 2 (2.7%) of the 73 twins showed these types of hip.

She denied any known precipitant for her depression.She is a ninth grade honors student in the gifted program at a local high school and is described as a talented musician, playing multiple musical instruments as well as soccer and basketball. She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling \"sad and anxious.\" Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation. She reported feeling grandiose, empowered, invincible, elated, and \"crazy,\" although she never demonstrated or endorsed psychotic symptoms. She became fixated upon the idea that she could kill someone and \"get away with it.\" At the time she tried to suffocate a peer with her hands, she was described as having \"a glazed over look in her eyes.\" Moods were now described as alternating between depressed and elated, with mood shifts occurring every few days. These symptoms did not improve after the antidepressant medication was discontinued.Subsequently, patient was admitted for acute psychiatric care, at which time she was described as depressed, but with an \"expansive and irritable\" mood, and with obsessive suicidal ideation. She had developed a plan to hang herself in the home. She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her \"poison.\" She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel \"safe.\" She claimed to have an \"entity inside of her body who was a bully\" and who was \"taking over her body\" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act \"more like herself\"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition to individual Dialectical Behavior Therapy, finally led to improvement of mood and a gradual return of her normal baseline, with reportedly stable emotional, social, and academic functioning.The patient's mother remained convinced that this adolescent's mood instability was caused by underlying hormonal problems so you refer her to endocrinology. Beth developed puberty at age 8, with menses occurring on average of twice yearly. She was found to have elevated free testosterone level of 8.6 (reference range, 1.2-7.5). She was of normal weight (body mass index = 21.85 kg/m) and did not manifest acne, male pattern hair thinning, or hirsutism.

She denied any known precipitant for her depression.She is a ninth grade honors student in the gifted program at a local high school and is described as a talented musician, playing multiple musical instruments as well as soccer and basketball. She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling \"sad and anxious.\" Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation. She reported feeling grandiose, empowered, invincible, elated, and \"crazy,\" although she never demonstrated or endorsed psychotic symptoms. She became fixated upon the idea that she could kill someone and \"get away with it.\" At the time she tried to suffocate a peer with her hands, she was described as having \"a glazed over look in her eyes.\" Moods were now described as alternating between depressed and elated, with mood shifts occurring every few days. These symptoms did not improve after the antidepressant medication was discontinued.Subsequently, patient was admitted for acute psychiatric care, at which time she was described as depressed, but with an \"expansive and irritable\" mood, and with obsessive suicidal ideation. She had developed a plan to hang herself in the home. She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her \"poison.\" She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel \"safe.\" She claimed to have an \"entity inside of her body who was a bully\" and who was \"taking over her body\" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act \"more like herself\"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition to individual Dialectical Behavior Therapy, finally led to improvement of mood and a gradual return of her normal baseline, with reportedly stable emotional, social, and academic functioning.The patient's mother remained convinced that this adolescent's mood instability was caused by underlying hormonal problems so you refer her to endocrinology. Beth developed puberty at age 8, with menses occurring on average of twice yearly. She was found to have elevated free testosterone level of 8.6 (reference range, 1.2-7.5). She was of normal weight (body mass index = 21.85 kg/m) and did not manifest acne, male pattern hair thinning, or hirsutism.

The patient had an onset of micrographia at 23 years of the age in 1939. Seven years later he started to drag his right foot, and at 38 years of age, he walked with small steps with festination. Tremor was also present in his right hand. His daily life was independent as a otorhinolaryngologist. He visited our clinic on March 24, 1977 when he was mentally sound and showed mild parkinsonism consisting of masked face, stooped posture, small step gait, bradykinesia, and right side dominant rigidity and tremor. He showed good response to trihexyphenidyl and amantadine HCl. Two month later, he developed dyskinesia and some worsening of parkinsonism, and was admitted to our hospital for the first time. He was treated with 400 to 600 mg/day of levodopa/ carbidopa. He showed marked improvement, however, dyskinesia remained in his mouth. He was doing well until 77 years of age (June of 1993) when he developed hallucination and motor fluctuations. He was admitted again to our hospital on June 22, 1993. On admission, he was alert and appeared mentally sound. However, Hasegawa dementia scale was 18/30. Upward gaze was slightly restricted (3/5). Voice was somewhat small but no masking was noted. His posture was stooped and the gait was of small step. Dyskinesia was noted during walk. No rigidity nor tremor was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were lost but no sensory loss or motor weakness was noted. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. A cranial CT scan revealed only mild to moderate cortical atrophy. Motor and sensory conduction velocities were within normal limits, however, motor action potentials could not be obtained with stimulation to the right common peroneal nerve. He was treated with 600 mg/day of levodopa with carbidopa, 100 mg of amantadine HCl, 300 mg of Dops, and 25 mg of tiapride. He continued to show motor fluctuations, and was discharged on July 23, 1993. Since then his motor functions had become progressively worse with frequent falls, but he was still able to walk without support. On October 3 of 1994, he went to bed as usual. On the next morning, he was found dead in his bed at 9: 30. The patient was discussed in neurological CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had young-onset Parkinson's disease with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. Opinions were divided between Parkinson's disease and Lewy body negative young onset parkinsonism. Postmortem examination revealed obstruction of the trachea by aspirated foods, and the cause of death appeared to have been suffocation by the foods. Macroscopically, the external appearance of the brain was unremarkable except for slight frontal atrophy. The substantia nigra showed depigmentation in the lateral part, but the pigmentation of the medial part was well preserved. Upon histologic examination, the number of pigmented neurons in the dorsomedial part was well preserved. In the lateral part, pigmented neurons were well preserved in the dorsal area, however, in the ventral area, only non-pigmented neurons were seen; they appeared to be neurons in the pars reticulata. No gliosis was seen in any of the nigral areas. No Lewy bodies were seen in the remaining neurons. So-called immature neurons with rounded shape without neuromelanin could not be detected. The locus coeruleus neurons were well preserved. The putamen and the other basal ganglia structures were also intact. Slight myelin pallor was noted in the subcortical white matter, however, otherwise cerebral cortices were normal. The histology of this patient is unique in that only the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra showed abnormal finding consisting of lack of pigmented neurons without gliosis.

She had since childhood been suffering from atopy, with bronchial asthma and polyvalent allergies. On examination, which was otherwise unremarkable, her blood pressure was 140/100 mm Hg with a sinus tachycardia of 110/min. She was admitted for implantation of an event recorder to establish the etiology of the described symptoms.INVESTIGATIONS: The results of routine laboratory tests, including those of thyroid function, were within normal limits. The ECG showed sinus rhythm and minor left precordinal abnormalities of repolarization. The echocardiogram was normal and coronary angiography excluded coronary heart disease.TREATMENT AND COURSE: 3 weeks after ambulatory implantation of an event recorder (Reveal, Medtronic) she again had an attack. The recorded ECG indicated a supraventricular tachycardia (190/min), preceded by an atrial extrasystole, lasting 3 min 14 s. She was treated with digitalis and verapamil, her asthma contraindicating solatol. She had refused further invasive diagnostic measures. The appearance of an allergic rash required a change of drugs to propafenon. But as this, too, was poorly tolerated, electrophysiological testing was undertaken. It revealed an AV nodal reentry tachycardia which was treated with local ablation: supraventricular extrasystoles continued to occur frequently, but there were no further episodes of reentry tachycardia.CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent syncopes, but otherwise unremarkable clinical findings, an implantable event recorder may provide important diagnostic information, especially relating to a possible arrhythmogenic cause.", "label": 0}

In adults, HSV type 1 is found predominantly in the oral area, and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) is commonly found in the genital area. HSV-2 infection without genital lesions is uncommon. Herein we report a unique case of pharyngotonsillitis as an initial manifestation of disseminated HSV-2 infection without genital involvement.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and sore throat. His past medical history included hypereosinophilic syndrome diagnosed at age 45\u2009years. Physical examination revealed throat congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy in the left posterior triangle, and mild epigastric tenderness. The laboratory data demonstrated bicytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear showed hypocellular marrow with histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The diagnosis of HLH was confirmed, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy on days 1-3. On day 5, despite initial improvement of the fever and sore throat, multiple, new, small bullae developed on the patient's face, trunk, and extremities. Additional testing showed that he was positive for HSV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Disseminated HSV infection was suspected, and intravenous acyclovir (10\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h) was begun. A subsequent direct antigen test of a bulla sample was positive for HSV-2. Moreover, tonsillar and esophageal biopsies revealed viral inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed the presence of HSV-2. Disseminated HSV-2 infection with multiple bullae, tonsillitis, esophagitis, and suspected hepatic involvement was diagnosed. After a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir, his hematological status and liver function normalized, and his cutaneous skin lesions resolved. He was discharged on day 22 in good general health and continued taking oral valacyclovir for viral suppression due to his immunosuppressed status.CONCLUSION: Disseminated HSV-2 infection should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and impaired liver function of unknown etiology even if there are no genital lesions.", "label": 0}

He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 50/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days).

The second one is a case of uremia, due to unknown etiology, suddenly developing right scrotal and penile swelling after 5 months of CAPD. The third one is a case with uremia of uncertain etiology, suffering from bilateral scrotal and penile swelling in the first month of CAPD, following a wrong procedure, by adding some 200cc more dialysate. Three mCi of Tc-99m phytate or pertechnetate, added into the bag of peritoneal dialysate for each patient, allowed us to visualize a peritoneo-vaginal communication. After surgery one of the patients who had been given followup treatment by radionuclide scintigraphy showed no passage of the labeled infusion in the swollen side of the scrotum. A previous postmortem study of adults dying without clinically apparent inguinal hernia demonstrated an open processus vaginalis in 20% of groins examined.

He visited his wife's primary care physician for evaluation. He denied neurologic symptoms or worsening of pain while lying down. He smoked (30 pack-years, quit 4 years ago), and drinks 3 beers each evening and more on weekends (up to a six-pack). He has had two lower extremity fractures from falls at construction sites. At the time of the physical examination, he was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 194 pounds. He was alert, oriented, and in mild distress. He had no percussion tenderness of his spine, and a neurologic examination was negative. A digital rectal examination revealed an enlarged prostate with an area of induration of the left, normal rectal tone, and guaiac-negative stool. Laboratory studies included normal blood counts, electrolytes, and renal and liver function tests (including lactic acid dehydrogenase and total protein). The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 114 ng/mL; he had no prior PSA test. A bone scan showed diffuse bony involvement including the T7 vertebral body and left pedicle, ribs, pelvis, and calvarium. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine confirmed bone metastases but showed no evidence of extension into the epidural space or spinal cord compromise. A prostate biopsy revealed Gleason 4+4 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Androgen deprivation therapy with leuprolide acetate was initiated, and the addition of a bone-targeted agent was considered.

In June 1988, she suffered the first episode of high fever, headache and general fatigue. Since then, those symptoms attacked her recurrently at intervals of 7 to 10 days. She was admitted to a hospital for two months in 1988. However, the etiology was unclear and treatment, including antibiotics, was not effective. After admission to our hospital, the symptoms of high fever, headache and general fatigue developed suddenly, lasted for 2 to 4 days, then disappeared spontaneously. These symptoms recurred periodically at intervals of 7 to 10 days. Findings of lumbar puncture during the period with severe symptoms revealed a leukocytic pleocytosis (polymorphonuclear neutrophil count: 1,324/3 mm3, mononuclear cell count: 48/3 mm3, without Mollaret cells) increased protein (0.81 g/l) and decreased glucose (0.28 g/l). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination during the period without symptoms showed a dramatic decrease of pleocytosis (polymorphonuclear neutrophil count: 5/3 mm3, mononuclear cell count: 17/3 mm3, without Mollaret cells) with improved protein (0/64 g/l) and glucose (0.40 g/l). Various examinations revealed no evidence of infection, malignancy, collagen disease, endocrine disease or any disorders in the nervous system. Moreover, bacterial cultures of blood and CSF were negative and a brain CT scan showed no abnormal findings. We diagnosed this case as Mollaret's meningitis and gave 25 mg indomethacin after every meal (75 mg/day). Her symptoms were improved abruptly and the duration of symptoms shortened and symptom-free intervals became longer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "label": 1}

A pea-sized swelling was first noticed on the back of the left hand, which was gradual in onset and slowly progressed to its present size. The patient later noticed multiple swellings over his left leg and thigh, with a similar progression. There was no history suggestive of inflammatory changes or discharge from the lesions. There was no previous history of trauma. The patient was an asthmatic and was on long-term oral steroid therapy (10-20 mg/day prednisolone). None of his family members had similar complaints. On physical examination, the patient was febrile. Cutaneous examination showed multiple, circumscribed, lobulated, non-tender, mobile, cystic swellings of various sizes, ranging from less than 2 cm over the left shin to more than 8 cm over the dorsum of the left hand and ankle (Fig. 1a,b). The surface over these swellings was shiny, smooth, and intact. The skin over the swellings was pliable and normal in color. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, except for decreased breath sounds over the left mid and lower pulmonary lobes. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count and liver and renal function tests, were within normal limits. Random blood glucose was greater than 400 mg%. Histopathologic examination of one of the cysts (from the hand) showed pheohyphomycotic cysts lined by dense fibrous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate admixed with scattered giant cells in the dermis (Fig. 2). No fungal elements were visualized in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The fungal elements were found within the cystic cavity on special staining with Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) and Masson-Fontana stains. The hyphae had irregularly placed branches and showed constrictions around their septae, thus resembling pseudohyphae and yeast forms (Fig. 3). Fine needle aspiration cytology from one of the swellings showed the presence of filamentous fungi on KOH examination and brown-pigmented distorted filaments and yeast-like cells on Masson-Fontana staining (Fig. 4a,b). The positive Masson-Fontana stain was indicative of the presence of melanin in the fungal hyphae, even when the fungal hyphae were not pigmented in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained section. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent also stained the fungal elements, thus confirming our diagnosis of pheohyphomycosis and ruling out the possibility of hyalohyphomycosis. The culture for fungus from the swelling aspirate grew contaminants. The chest X-ray showed dense nodular shadows in the left lower and mid pulmonary lobes. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and Mantoux test were negative. During the hospital stay, the patient developed high fever and showed altered behavior, for which a computed tomography scan of the brain was performed; this showed evidence of multiple ring enhancing lesions in both frontal lobes. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. On the basis of the above findings, a diagnosis of disseminated subcutaneous pheohyphomycosis was made. The patient was given itraconazole, 100 mg twice daily, and his diabetes was managed with insulin. The fever stopped within a week and the altered behavior also started to show an improvement.

The subsequent cervical biopsy revealed dCIN. The cone biopsy showed the invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma (ICC) that developed from the overlying dCIN. Review of 32 consecutive cases of ICC revealed a second case of dCIN-associated ICC (Group 1) preceded by ASCUS suspicious for high-grade neoplastic cells. In both cases, the ASCUS were keratinised atypical cells without koilocytosis. In addition, there were another seven cases showing focal dCIN associated with extensive usual CIN (Group 2). In comparison with the remaining 24 cases with usual CIN (Group 3), Group 2 lesions occurred in younger patients (mean ages of 363 vs 479years) and were associated with shorter intervals after the last normal Pap smears.

Only 5-10% of women with ASCUS harbour serious cervical disease.METHODS: We screened 3619 women, who attended to Mirza Koochak Khan Hospital at Tehran University of Medical Sciences with Pap smears, of whom 100 returned with ASCUS. After six months, each subject underwent a standard cytology (conventional Pap smear), human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing (identifying high-risk HPV types with polymerase chain reaction) and colposcopy with multiple cervical biopsies.RESULTS: Mean age was 44.09 +/- 8.6 years. The estimated prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or higher was 4%. When histologically verified high-grade lesions (> or = CIN II) were observed, the relative sensitivity of HPV DNA testing was 100% compared with conventional Pap smear, which performed 75% versus 100% relative sensitivity, respectively, using cytological diagnosis high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) as the cut-off. Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of Pap test were 98.9% and 100%. The NPV and PPV of HPV DNA testing were 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Although less complicated than colposcopy, the repeat Pap smear triage algorithm for ASCUS may underdiagnose some women with high-grade CIN, when compared with colposcopy. Considering the high sensitivity of HPV testing, it may be useful as an alternative to the current policy of six-month repeat cytology for women with ASCUS results.", "label": 0}

The mean age was 14.6 years, ranging from 8 to 35 years. About 2 cm long incision was made at the tip of the medial prominence of the navicular bone. After partial dissection of the posterior tibial tendon, the accesssory navicular bone was exposed and excisied. The prominence of the tuberosity of the navicular bone was cut and shaved. The posterior tibial tenden was repaired before closing the wound. The foot was immobilized with cast or brace in inversion position and no weight-bearing for 2 weeks. Strenuous jumping or dancing must be avoided in 3 months after surgery. The patients with residual symptoms and signs received physical therapy and an arch support for shoes without flatfoot deformity.RESULTS: The average clinical follow-up during was 12 month (ranged, 3 to 18 months). The excellent results in 21 feet and good in 4 feet (3 feet with mild flat deformity and 1 foot with old sprain injury). The average hospital stay was 5 days and no wound infection occurred. All patients resumed the normal life and study after operation.CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of the accessory navicular syndrome with simple excision has the advantages of less invasive to the posterior tibial tenden and the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, shorter time of immobilization of the foot and stay in hospital, small incision and good clinical results. This procedure is one of the best selective treatments for the accessory navicular syndrome, especially for the patients without flatfoot deformity and old sprain injury.", "label": 1}

", "knowledge": "BACKGROUND: We reviewed a series of newborns, toddlers and ambulating children affected by idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot). Taking into account the time of diagnosis, stiffness of the deformity and walking age, nonsurgical or surgical treatment was considered. This study reports clinical outcomes, early complications and relapse at mid-term follow-up.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two clubfeet were diagnosed at birth, 12 in non-ambulating children aged between 4 and 12 months and 24 in ambulating children. Feet were classified using the Pirani score. Newborns and toddlers were treated with serial casting (Ponseti); however, toddlers also underwent open Achilles tendon lengthening (2 feet) and posteromedial release (3 feet). In all ambulating children, surgical treatment was always performed: selective medial release combined with cuboid subtraction osteotomy (1 foot), posteromedial release (6 feet), and posteromedial release combined with cuboid subtraction osteotomy (17 feet).RESULTS: The average follow-up was 5 years (1-6 years). In newborns treated with Ponseti, the results were excellent in 42 feet, good in 6, and poor in 4. In non-ambulating children, the results were excellent in 9 feet, and good in 3. In ambulating children, the results were excellent in 5 feet, good in 16, and poor in 3. No major complications were reported. No overcorrections were observed. The need for open surgery was higher in cases of delayed treatment. In cases of relapse, re-casting and/or more extensive surgery was considered.CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment enables a high rate of good correction to be obtained with serial casting and limited surgery. Conversely, if the deformity is observed after walking age surgery should be considered. Serial casting in cases of late observation and relapse have demonstrated encouraging results.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.", "label": 0}

His medical history was significant for a gunshot wound to the head 3 years prior, with a residual seizure disorder. He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg).

Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days).

We present a case of simvastatin-induced muscle toxicity that disappeared when pravastatin was substituted for the original drug.CASE OUTLINE: A 74-year-old male, a nonsmoker, complained of severe nocturnal leg cramps. The patient also complained that similar painful cramping occurred when he walked rapidly or jogged. Because some components of his lipid panel exceeded the'desirable' range, and as he had a history of myocardial infarction, his family physician prescribed simvastatin (40 mg/day). The patient had taken this medication for the past eight years. The painful nocturnal episodes started two years ago and affected either one or the other leg. Four months ago we discontinued his simvastatin and prescribed pravastatin (80 mg/day). At a follow-up visit six weeks later, the patient reported that his leg pains at night and the pain experienced after brisk walking had disappeared. Four months after the substitution of pravastatin for simvastatin, the patient reported that his complete lack of symptoms had continued.CONCLUSION: These painful muscle cramps were probably caused by an inadequate vascular supply to the calf and foot muscles. Perhaps a combination of advanced age and atherosclerotic changes created a predisposition for the simvastatin-induced leg cramps. Pravastatin differs from simvastatin in several ways.l It is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 oxidases, and thus is not influenced by CYP 3A4 inhibitors like simvastatin. Also, simvastatin is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within the SLCO1B1 gene on the chromosome 12 and established myopathy, while pravastatin lacks this association. These differences may contribute to increased tolerance to pravastatin in this particular case.", "label": 0}

While the angle of the mouth was superficially involved on the left side, the oral mucosa was normal. The right cheek also showed a few areas of scarring with patches of alopecia. There were no similar lesions elsewhere on the body. The peculiar history and the morphology of the lesion, that defied any classical diagnosis description, prompted us to interrogate both the man and his wife with regard to any serious differences. After much persuasion and on assurance of secrecy, the wife admitted that her husband was an alcoholic and was neglecting his family. When her efforts to prevent his drinking failed, she resorted to this drastic measure. Each time he passed out after a drinking bout, she poured acid on his cheek, hoping that the sequelae would frighten him from drinking. The acid was readily available to her as she used it for domestic cleaning. The couple were sent for psychiatric evaluation as Munchausen's syndrome by proxy (MSBP) or witchcraft's syndrome (WS) was suspected. Detailed psychiatric evaluation, together with psychometric assessment, revealed that the patient had an alcohol dependence (Axis-I diagnosis) and had a cyclothymic personality. Severe marital discord due to alcohol dependence had been present for the past 2 years. Evaluation of the patient's wife revealed that she was under significant psychologic distress. She showed major depressive symptoms with a histrionic personality. She revealed that she had resorted to using the corrosive out of frustration and anger over the behavior of the patient while he was in an inebriated state.

", "knowledge": "INTRODUCTION: Many authors have described these last years the difficulty to establish a differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and frontotemporal dementia. However treatment and prognosis of these two separate diseases are not the same. Schizophrenia is a chronic syndrome with an early onset during teenage or young adulthood period and the major features consist of delirious ideas, hallucinations and psychic dissociation. However a large variety of different symptoms describes the disease and creates a heterogeneous entity. The diagnosis, exclusively defined by clinical signs, is then difficult and has led to the research of specific symptoms. These involve multiple psychological processes, such as perception (hallucinations), reality testing (delusions), thought processes (loose associations), feeling (flatness, inappropriate affect), behaviour (catatonia, disorganization), attention, concentration, motivation (avolition), and judgement. The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia have often been conceptualised as falling into three broad categories including positive (hallucination, delision), negative (affective flattening, alogia, avolition) and disorganised (poor attention, disorganised speech and behaviour) symptoms. No single symptom is pathogonomonic of schizophrenia. These psychological and behavioural characteristics are associated with a variety of impairments in occupational or social functioning. Cognition impairments are also associated with schizophrenia. Since the original clinical description by Kraepelin and Bleuler, abnormalities in attentional, associative and volitional cognitive processes have been considered central features of schizophrenia. Long term memory deficits, attentional and executive dysfunctions are described in the neurocognitive profile of schizophrenic patients, with a large degree of severity. The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is not well known but may be better understood by neuronal dysfunctions rather than by a specific anatomical abnormality. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is one of the most common causes of cortical dementia. FTLD is associated with an anatomical atrophy that can be generalised, with a frontotemporal or focal lobar predominance. Histologically there is severe neuronal loss, gliosis and a state of spongiosis. In a minority of case Pick cells and Pick bodies are also found. The usual clinical features of FTLD are divided in three prototypic syndromes: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA) and semantic dementia (SD). FTD is the most common clinical manifestation of FTLD. FTD is first characterised by profound alteration in personality and social conduct, characterised by inertia and loss of volition or social disinhibition and distractibility. There is emotional blunting and loss of insight. Speech output is typically economical, leading ultimately to mutism, although a press of speech may be present in some overactive, disinhibited patients. Memory is relatively preserved in the early stage of the disease. Cognitive deficits occur in the domains of attention, planning and problems solving, whereas primary tools of language, perception and spatial functions are well preserved. PA is an initial disorder of expressive language, characterised by effortful speech production, phonologic and grammatical errors. Difficulties in reading and writing also occur but understanding of word meaning is relatively well preserved. In SD a severe naming and word comprehension impairment occur on the beginning in the context of fluent, effortless, and grammatical speech output. There is also an inability to recognise the meaning of visual percepts. The clinical syndromes of FTLD are associated with the brain topography of the degeneration. So considerable clinical overlap can exist between schizophrenia and FTLD and the object of the following case report is to remind the difficulty to make a differential diagnosis between these two pathologies.CASE REPORT: A 34 year old non-married man is admitted in mental health district of a general hospital for behavioural disturbances that include repeated aggressions towards his family. At initial interview visual and auditives hallucinations are described. The patient doesn't care about these abnormalities and a poverty of speech is observed. The affects, globally blunted, show some degree of sadness however. The patient's birth and early development were unremarkable. At the age of 26, the patient dismissed from his job because of poor performance and absenteeism. He spent a lot of time watching TV, showed poverty of speech and become sometimes angry and violent without an explanation. He was hospitalised for several months and a schizophrenia including predominant negative features, hallucinations and delusion was diagnosed. He was treated with bromperidol, could go back to home and was followed by a general practitioner for 8 years. The patient had a stereotyped way of life during these years with a poor communication and little activity. During the months preceding the current hospitalisation, these characteristics and avolition emphasised, urinary incontinence appeared. The patient receives risperidone 8 mg/day associated with citalopram 40 mg/day during several months of hospitalisation. No significant evolution is observed regarding apathic and stereotyped way of live. The capacity of communication remains very poor. Neurocognitive assessments reveal multiple and severe dysfunctions. Memory, executive and attentional tasks are extremely disturbed. Physical and neurological examinations reveal an isolated bilateral Babinski sign. Cerebral scanner and magnetic resonance show bifrontal atrophy and PET scan is normal. There are no significant abnormalities found on blood and urine samples and on lumbar puncture. The patient is sent to a chronic neuropsychiatric hospital and the treatment is stopped. One year later, a comparative evaluation is realised. The general clinical state shows no evolution. Neurocognitive assessments are repeated and severe dysfunctions are observed with more perseverations.DISCUSSION: A diagnosis of FTLD for this patient can be discussed regarding clinical features, neurocognitive testings and neuroradiological findings. Schizophrenia is a major differential diagnosis. Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and age of onset are essential observations for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but can not exclude FTLD. Memory, intellectual functions, executive and attentional abilities may all be disturbed in schizophrenia and FTLD. Cerebral abnormalities well established in schizophrenia are lateral ventricles enlargements. Frontal lobar atrophy is a major argument for FTLD and is only a sporadic finding in schizophrenic populations. Schizophrenia and FTLD could be comorbid diseases by several ways.CONCLUSION: A differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and FTLD is difficult to establish. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Neurocognitive tools may improve our knowledge of schizophrenia.", "label": 0}

There was marked tenderness and guarding at the lower abdomen.DIAGNOSES: Blood investigations were unremarkable, while abdominal ultrasonography found a live twin gestation with foetal heartbeats of 185 and 180\u200abeats/min. MRI of the abdomen revealed an empty uterine cavity; 2 amniotic sacs and fetuses of diameter 10\u200acm, and a single placenta were noted in the right uterine adnexa. The patient was diagnosed with right live monochorionic diamniotic twin tubal pregnancy.INTERVENTION: Our patient underwent emergency laparoscopic right salpingectomy.OUTCOMES: The operation was successful and her postoperative care remained uneventful up to discharge.LESSONS: Ectopic pregnancy cannot be ruled out based on prior normal antenatal examinations and gestational age of >10 weeks. EPs should not hesitate to order MRI scans for further evaluation if ultrasonography and laboratory findings are equivocal.", "label": 1}

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of pregnancy outcome in women over age 50 who conceived using donor oocytes. This study presents the pregnancy and delivery data on two women who delivered at age 52.CASES: Case 1 was a 51-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, whose three children had been conceived with her first husband more than 20 years previously. She had remarried 18 years before presentation and had been actively trying to conceive for the last 7 years. She was diagnosed as being in menopause based on elevated gonadotropins, amenorrhea, and failure to have progesterone-withdrawal menses. She conceived on her first embryo transfer cycle with embryos derived from donor oocytes and fertilized by her husband's sperm (oocytes were donated by a woman who was undergoing retrieval for in vitro fertilization). During pregnancy she remained healthy, but had uterine prolapse at 20 weeks. She delivered a normal healthy male at 40.5 weeks; cesarean was performed because of a presumptive diagnosis of fetal distress after 3 hours of labor, when monitoring revealed fetal heart decelerations. Case 2 was also a 51-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 4, who wished to conceive with her second husband's sperm through the donor oocyte program. She had amenorrhea of 2 years' duration and elevated gonadotropins. Conception occurred after fertilization of a donor oocyte by her husband's sperm. She had an uneventful pregnancy, but labor was induced at 38 weeks' gestation given the supposed high-risk status of this age group. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.CONCLUSION: Theoretically, the risks of pregnancy complications in older patients are magnified given the aging maternal cardiovascular system, which may predispose these women to placental insufficiency. These first two cases of donor oocyte pregnancies in women over age 50 found no maternal or fetal age-related complications. We hope these reports will encourage all researchers to share their findings so that prospective patients can make better, more informed decisions as to whether they want to participate in donor oocyte programs.", "label": 1}

", "knowledge": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is common in obese women with insulin resistant type 2 diabetes for which metformin treatment is getting established in addition to clomiphene. However, lean PCOS patients are sometimes accompanied with type 1 diabetes. It remains unclear whether these patients are insulin resistant and whether metformin is effective for them. A 32-year-old woman, who suffered from acne, hirsutism, and menstrual disorders since age 29, was diagnosed as PCOS by serum high LH levels and polycystic ovary on echography. Interestingly, her body mass index (BMI) had consistently been 21.0 kg/m2 since age 20. She was first treated with clomiphene for one year for infertility but it did not improve her menstrual cycle nor did she get pregnant during that period. She was then assessed with diabetes mellitus and subsequently diagnosed as type 1 diabetes with mild hyperglycemia (HbA1c 6.0%). Since her insulin secretion was still well preserved, to assess insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test was performed and showed her to be insulin resistant. Low dose insulin and low dose metformin treatment was started without clomiphene. After her ovulation and menstrual cycle were ameliorated only one month later, her treatment was supplemented with clomiphene for the next three months enabling her to at last become pregnant. This report highlights the efficacy of metformin in lean PCOS with type 1 diabetes. Insulin therapy is essential for type 1 diabetes but hyperinsulinemia potentially exacerbates PCOS through hyperandrogenism. Metformin is therefore recommended for treatment of lean PCOS with type 1 diabetes as well as common obese PCOS with type 2 diabetes.", "label": 1}

Apart from nuclear abnormalities, one can observe unusual findings. Long-term followup by Pap smear following detection of S haematobium revealed that in the absence of human papillomavirus, S haematobium alone is not the causative agent for the abnormal proliferation of squamous epithelium of the cervix.

Management largely depends on affected vessel disease severity and individual patient considerations. The diagnosis must be considered in a young patient with large vessel aneurysms. We present a case of a 30 year-old woman of Pacific Islander descent who presented to the Tripler Army medical Center Vascular Surgery Department in Honolulu, Hawai'i seeking repair of her abdominal aortic and renal artery aneurysms prior to conception. A 30 year-old Pacific Islander woman with a history of a saccular abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery aneurysms presented to our clinic seeking vascular surgery consultation prior to a planned pregnancy. She had a renal artery stent placed at an outside institution for hypertension. She met the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis by Sharma's criteria. Physical exam was significant for a palpable, pulsatile, abdominal mass and CT angiography revealed a saccular irregular-appearing infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm, extending to the aortic bifurcation, with a maximum diameter of 3.3 cm. A right renal artery aneurysm was also identified proximally, contiguous with the aorta, with a maximal transverse diameter of 1.7 cm. The patient underwent a supraceliac bypass to the right renal artery with a 7 mm Dacron graft, as well as excision of the right renal artery aneurysm. The abdominal aortic aneurysm was replaced using a Hemashield Dacron bifurcated 14 mm x 7 mm bypass graft. Intraoperative measurements of the renal artery aneurysm were 1.5 x 1.5 cm and the saccular appearing distal abdominal aortic aneurysm measured 3.6 x 3.3 cm. The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days post-operatively. At 1-year follow up, CT scan of the abdominal aorta revealed the repair was without any evidence of aneurysm formation, anastomotic pseudoaneurysm formation, or areas of stenosis. She has remained normotensive with a normal serum creatinine 18 months after her repair. She has since delivered her second child. It is rare for Takayasu's arteritis to present with aneurysmal disease. It is much more common to present with stenosis or occlusion. It has yet to be proven that Takayasu's truly has a higher incidence in those of Asian descent. Takayasu's can be a difficult diagnosis to make but can be aided with the use of Sharma's criteria. Our particular patient posed unique considerations on the effects of the physiology of pregnancy on her aneurysms and repair. Managing the active phases of disease is imperative, and though medical management is first line, surgical intervention may be necessary. Surgical intervention should be performed in a quiescent period of disease if possible given that biological inflammation at the time of intervention increases the complication rate. Repair of aneurysmal disease in a young female should also be considered prior to pregnancy.", "label": 0}

His biological mother used heroin, tobacco, and cocaine during pregnancy. From 8 weeks to 18 months, he spent time in a foster home where he was provided limited attention and nurturing. At age 18 months, he entered a loving foster home; at 26 months, he was adopted. There is maternal history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disability, depression, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse but no history of autism or cognitive disability. Chase received early intervention before adoption. Specific concerns are unknown. At the time of his adoption, he had delays in gross motor and fine motor skills, nonverbal communication, and speech production. Familiar listeners find Chase to be 100% intelligible but unfamiliar listeners understand about 70% of what Chase says. He enjoys being with his adopted mother and imitating her. He has demonstrated significant anxiety during his play therapy. He has difficulty in paying attention to multistep directions. Chase can point and wave but has difficulty following someone's eyes to see where another person is looking. Chase enjoys a variety of interests but has a special fixation on Toy Story characters. Chase does initiate social interactions but can be aggressive toward his siblings and oppositional toward his parents. He is not aggressive at school. Teachers note hyperactivity and impulsivity. Chase is bothered by bright lights and by others making loud noises but has no difficulty with crowds. Chase is reported to have difficulty in transitioning between activities. At his 5-year-old visit, you as well as his mother and therapists note that he has trouble following with his eyes so he is referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist. Evaluation showed Chase was able to fix on and follow objects and light, his peripheral vision was normal, his pupils were equal and reactive without afferent pupillary defect, and normal visual tracking as assessed through pursuit and saccades. There were some head jerking motions observed which were not thought to be part of Chase's attempts to view objects. Gaze impersistence was noted, although it was not clear if this was due to a lack of attention or a true inability to maintain a gaze in the direction instructed. On review of the school's speech and language report, they state that he is >90% intelligible. He has occasional lip trills. Testing with the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals shows mild delays in receptive language, especially those that require visual attention. Verbal Motor Production Assessment for Children reveals focal oromotor control and sequencing skills that are below average, with groping when asked to imitate single oromotor nonspeech movements and sequenced double oromotor nonspeech movements. At 5 years, he returns for follow-up, and he is outgoing and imaginative, eager to play and socialize. He makes eye contact but does not always maintain it. He asks and responds to questions appropriately, and he is able to follow verbal directions and verbal redirection. He is very interested in Toy Story characters but willing to share them and plays with other toys. Chase's speech has predictable, easy to decode sound substitutions. On interview with him, you feel that he has borderline cognitive abilities.

Frequently, patients have a history of exogenous progesterone intake (1,5,6), as in our patient, which could have resulted in antibody formation. The diagnosis of APD is established by an appropriate clinical history (premenstrual flare of skin lesions), a progesterone intradermal test, an intramuscular (7), oral (8), or intravaginal (1, 6) progesterone challenge test, and circulating antibodies to progesterone. Progesterone testing has not been standardized. Most of the sex hormones are not suitable for testing since they contain an oily component that can produce an irritant test reaction. Gestodene, which was used for the oral provocation test in our patient, is a potent progesterone (9). The LTT shows reactions to circulating lymphocytes and reflects immune reactions within the body.

These symptoms would resolve upon squatting or lying down and did not occur spontaneously at rest. He did not lose consciousness during the attacks. Speech, power, and sensation were preserved during these attacks. He had no history of seizures or habit of smoking. On examination, his supine blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, and 62/27 mmHg on standing, with the pulse rate being 61/min and 66/min, respectively. Although he showed orthostatic hypotension, he did not complain of fainting or lightheadedness on standing alone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed mild periventricular white matter changes and multiple small ischemic lesions bilaterally in the cerebral deep white matter. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed mild, generalized slowing of nonspecific feature. EEG monitoring during a limb shaking episode showed no epileptiform abnormalities. Cerebral angiogram revealed a moderate degree of stenosis of the left internal carotid and a mild degree of stenosis of the right internal carotid, the right vertebral arteries and the left vertebral arteries. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed a moderate compromise of perfusion of the left internal carotid territory. After managing both hypotension and orthostatic hypotension with antihypotensive medication and levothyroxine sodium, his symptoms dramatically disappeared. Thus, we diagnosed that transient hemodynamic insufficiency due to combination of vascular stenosis and hypotension was the cause of these symptoms. Limb shaking is a well-described presentation of carotid artery occlusive disease and is usually unilateral. Bilateral limb shaking is rare and only 2 cases have been reported. Metamorphopsia is also a rare symptom of vertebrobasilar ischemia. We suggest that bilateral limb shaking correlates with hypoperfusion in the anterior border zones and metamorphopsia with that in the posterior border zones of both hemispheres.

There was no significant abnormality on physical examination, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasound. Histology examination of the biopsy specimen taken during the upper endoscopy revealed Helicobacter pylori associated active gastritis only in the corporal part of the stomach. After two weeks eradication therapy (Omeprazole, Amoxicillin) he was well. Three months later, at the control endoscopy, granulomatous gastritis of the corporal localization was detected, without Helicobacter pylori present. Antral mucosa appeared normal, both, on endoscopy and histology examination. In July 1996 he started with cramping abdominal pain, mild periodical fever and episodes of watery diarrhea. In laboratory results we found nonspecific signs of inflammation. We repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and enteroclysis--with evidence of segmental stenotic lesions of the upper part of ileum and jejunum.

There was no significant abnormality on physical examination, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasound. Histology examination of the biopsy specimen taken during the upper endoscopy revealed Helicobacter pylori associated active gastritis only in the corporal part of the stomach. After two weeks eradication therapy (Omeprazole, Amoxicillin) he was well. Three months later, at the control endoscopy, granulomatous gastritis of the corporal localization was detected, without Helicobacter pylori present. Antral mucosa appeared normal, both, on endoscopy and histology examination. In July 1996 he started with cramping abdominal pain, mild periodical fever and episodes of watery diarrhea. In laboratory results we found nonspecific signs of inflammation. We repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and enteroclysis--with evidence of segmental stenotic lesions of the upper part of ileum and jejunum.

Her Pap smear revealed inflammation with a S haematobium egg. She was followed up with Pap smears for 4 years. Retrospective contraceptive history revealed use ofa copper IUD on 5 occasions with a total duration of 13 years and 1 month. Similarly, annual follow-up of Pap smears for the past 13 years showed mild inflammation with bacterial vaginitis and monilial infection.

Apart from nuclear abnormalities, one can observe unusual findings. Long-term followup by Pap smear following detection of S haematobium revealed that in the absence of human papillomavirus, S haematobium alone is not the causative agent for the abnormal proliferation of squamous epithelium of the cervix.

She was two months pregnant at the time of the onset of the pigmentary change was also simultaneously diagnosed with a toxic nodular goiter of her thyroid gland. Initial fungal culture, KOH and biopsy were positive for fungal hyphae, and she was treated with four weeks of oral ketaconazole and topical selenium sulfide shampoo. As she had continued progression of her hypopigmented lesions after treatment for pityriasis versicolor, a thorough physical examination (under room light and Wood's lamp) and repeat biopsy were performed. On examination, she demonstrated persistence of the ovoid hypopigmented macules on her neck, chest and abdomen with interval improvement of the superficial scaling. Under Wood's lamp examination, hypopigmented lesions demonstrated a characteristic follicular pink fluorescence associated with porphyrin production by Propionobacterium acnes (P. acnes) described previously in the lesions of progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH). PMH was confirmed histologically by the findings in the second biopsy of a decrease in epidermal melanin pigment and the persistence of pityriasis versicolor was ruled out by an absence of fungal hyphae. Based upon the literature suggesting improvement of PMH with antibiotic therapy to decrease P. acnes colonization, she was treated with 10% benzoyl peroxide wash, clindamycin 1% solution and oral, twice-daily tetracycline 500 mg. During six months of this treatment, she experienced re-pigmentation of many of her existing skin lesions and cessation of the development of new hypopigmented macules.", "label": 0}

After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar. He was transferred to our hospital on July 14th. His past medical history revealed that he had suffered from frequent bouts of osteomyelitis since the age of 13 years. He was operated on several times on osteomyelitis. He had been treated on his tooth ache until shortly before the onset of the present illness. He also received steroid hormone for his Bell's palsy. On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 34 cells/microliter (approximately two thirds were neutrophils), RBC 1,110/microliter, 2,949 mg/dl of protein, and 119 mg/dl of glucose; stapylococcus aureus was cultured from the CSF. Myelogram showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space between the low thoracic and the upper lumbar region. The patient was treated with cephotaxim, aminobenzyl penicillin, and chloramphenicol. On the second hospital day, his BT was still 39 degrees C and he was agitated His weakness was worse than the previous day. Spinal MRI was attempted; as he was agitated 5 mg of diazepam was given intravenously at 4 PM. His respiration was rapid and somewhat shallow. At 6 PM, gadolinium DTPA was injected intravenously; at that time, he was breathing and pupils were 3 mm on both sides. At 6:35 PM, an examiner noted that he stopped breathing; the left pupil was dilated to 5 mm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately, and intubation was performed. He was placed on a respirator. His blood pressure did not reach 100 mmHg; he was in deep coma. Cardiac arrest occurred at 8:53 AM on the next morning. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC. Most of the participants thought that the patient had either spinal epidural empyema or spinal subdural abscess. The question was what might be the original focus of infection.

His medical history was significant for a gunshot wound to the head 3 years prior, with a residual seizure disorder. He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 50/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days).

Gait deviation to the left was present, and Romberg sign was negative. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout, and no other focal neurological deficit was present. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of stroke. Electrocardiogram, fasting lipid profile, computed tomography (CT) scan of head, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and neck, and transthoracic echo with bubble study were ordered. The initial head CT did not reveal bleeding. He was started on aspirin (ASA). On the second hospital day, the symptoms improved with resolution of dysarthria. His ataxia had also improved. Fasting lipid profile revealed mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. His head MRI revealed an acute right thalamic stroke. Echocardiography was significant only for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with transit of agitated saline \"bubbles\" from right atrium to left heart within three cardiac cycles (Figure). Doppler ultrasound of extremities revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A complete resolution of symptoms occurred by the third hospital day.

She denied fevers, chills, night sweats or cough. Her symptoms were unresponsive to a course of oral dicloxacillin. The neck mass enlarged over 8 weeks and she was referred to our institution for evaluation. CT scan of the neck showed an enlarged lymph node. Ten days prior to her presentation in dermatology, a fine needle aspirate of the enlarging lymph node revealed necrotizing granulomas. Tissue was sent for routine mycobacterial and fungal cultures. Routine blood work, chest radiograph, and a tuberculin skin test were also performed. At the time of her dermatology visit she described the development of multiple new painful, non-pruritic lesions, bilaterally on the lower extremities. She also reported a red crusted area that appeared at the site of her tuberculin test that was placed subsequent to the development of her lower extremity lesions.

Her right forearm revealed an erythematous, ulcerated, indurated plaque 1.5 cm in diameter (Fig. 2.). Her lower extremities revealed tender 0.5 to 1 cm erythematous nodules below the knees bilaterally (Fig. 3). A punch biopsy of a lower extremity nodule revealed a mild pervisacular dermal infiltrate. Within the subcutaneous tissue there was septal widening. There was also a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with a slight admixture of neutrophils within the septa of the fat lobules. There was no evidence of necrotizing vasculitis or collagen necrosis. An acid-fast stain was not performed. The histologic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of erythema nodosum. Her laboratory evaluation including CBC, electrolytes, thyroid studies, angiotensin converting enzyme level and chest radiograph were normal. Approximately 1 week after her dermatological evaluation, the fine-needle aspirate culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis associated with erythema nodosum was confirmed. The patient was started on quadruple therapy of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide.

After failing to respond to conservative management, she underwent an autologous epidural blood patch (EBP) at the T7-8 level. The headache and associated symptoms did not improve after the procedure. Magnetic resonance (MR) myelography suggested a cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the C1-2 level resulting in intracranial hypotension. An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted at the T1-2 interlaminal level using a paramedian approach under fluoroscopic guidance. The cervical epidural Racz catheter was threaded through the Tuohy needle up to the cervical spine and the catheter tip was confirmed to be at the right cervical 1-2 site on an anteroposterior (AP) view. Five mL of autologous blood was injected into the epidural space through the cervical epidural Racz catheter. Her occipital headache and associated symptoms gradually disappeared after the procedure. Seven days later the headache was largely resolved and she was discharged. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the disappearance of abnormal radiological features associated with intracranial hypotension. She currently remains symptom free for 9 months. Delivery of autologous blood patch via a cervical epidural Racz catheter inserted from the upper thoracic spine can be a safe and effective method for patients with SIH due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in the upper cervical spine.

The investigation enrolled all the patients admitted to the hospital over the analyzed period. DDD analysis and DU90% analysis were used as study methods.RESULTS: DDD analysis and DU90% analysis of antimicrobial therapy for CAP were carried out at the hospital in clinical practice during a year. The annual number of defined daily doses (NDDD) for antimicrobial drugs, the number of defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (NDDD/100 bed-days), and a drug load (g) per 1000 CAP patients per day and per CAP patient per year were determined. The largest NDDD/year for CAP treatment with ceftriaxone was 376 g, or 43.43 NDDD/100 bed-days, which is much higher than that with other antimicrobial agents. The daily drug load of ceftriaxone per 1,000 CAP patients was 8.8 g, which exceeds that of moxifloxacin by 18.7 times, azithromycin and levofloxacin by 5 times, and ampicillin/sulbactam by 2.3 times. The daily drug load of ceftriaxone per CAP patient was 3.2 g, which exceeds that of of ampicillin/sulbactam by 2.3 times, levofloxacin and azithromycin by 5 times, and moxifloxacin by 19 times.CONCLUSION: It may be recommended that the proportion of cephalosporins as drugs that promote the rise of resistance in microbes and their production of extended-spectrum -lactamases should be further limited, the proportion of penicillins be extended, and the administered ampicillin/sulbactam be added, for example, by amoxicillin/clavulanate. Penicillins contribute to the rise of resistance to a lesser degree, and the use of two different penicillin molecules specified in the guidelines for the treatment of CAP will be able to slow the process further.

Despite four units of blood transfusion, she had a pulse rate of 130/min, arterial pressure of 90/60 mm/Hg and HCT of 19%. An emergency hysterectomy with vertical incision was performed. CASE 2: A 54-year-old, gravida 3, para 3, woman was referred to our clinic with heavy bleeding with the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. She was scanned to look for possible metastases and pulmonary metastasis was detected. Chemotherapy was planned but as sudden vaginal bleeding began she was referred to the Gynecology Department. At pelvic examination a soft uterus the size of 20 weeks of gestation was palpated. The beta-hCG level was 554,700 mIU/ml. Due to hemodynamic instability and continuous vaginal bleeding an emergency hysterectomy was performed.CONCLUSION: Although chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for choriocarcinoma, optimal treatment results may depend on the addition of surgery in selected circumstances. Hysterectomy is indicated in cases with life-threatening hemorrhage.", "label": 1}

The physician proceeds to surgery of the son without transfusion.", "knowledge": "A 19-year-old man with a history of eczema was admitted to the emergency department following collapsing at home. The paramedics found him unresponsive with poor respiratory effort and a widespread erythematous rash. Anaphylaxis, thought to be secondary to flucloxacillin he had recently been prescribed, was diagnosed. Epinephrine, steroids and antihistamines were administered without clinical improvement. On arrival to hospital, constricted pupils were noted prompting the emergency physicians to consider opiate toxicity. Intravenous naloxone brought about an immediate recovery. His father subsequently disclosed that he had given his son one of his own fentanyl patches to alleviate the distressing symptoms of eczema. Although the patient had removed the patch prior to collapsing, he had suffered life-threatening opioid toxicity likely due to enhanced opiate absorption through eczematous skin.

He was admitted due to severe dyspnea with oxygen desaturation and heart murmur on the second day after birth. Physical examination showed clear consciousness, cyanosis, dyspnea, RR 70 bpm and a grade II/6 heart murmur. Bp was 56/45 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) and SpO2 around 65%. Blood WBC 13.1 x 10(9)/L, N 46.1%, Hb 238 g/L, Plt 283 x 10(9)/L, CRP < 1 mg/L. Echocardiographic findings: TGA + ASD + PDA with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%. After supportive care and prostaglandin E1 (5 ng/kg/min) treatment, his condition became stable with SpO2 85 - 90%. On the 6(th) day of life, the baby underwent an arterial switch procedure + ASD closing and PDA ligation. The time of aorta clamp was 72 mins.

ECMO setup: Medtronic pediatric ECMO package (CB2503R1), carmeda membrane oxygenator and centrifugal pump (bio-console 560) were chosen. Direct cannulation of the ascending aorta (Edward FEM008A) and right atrium (TF018090) was performed using techniques that were standard for cardiopulmanory bypass. The ECMO system was primed with 400 ml blood, 5% CaCl(2)1g, 5% sodium bicarbonate 1.5 g, 20% mannitol 2 g, albumin 10 g, and heparin 5 mg.

The first study was conducted at 9 AM and repeated 36 hours later at 9 PM. At 9 AM the following morning a continuous maternal dexamethasone infusion (15 micrograms/kg/hr given intravenously) was initiated, and the study was repeated at 9 PM, 60 hours later. Four doses of oxytocin (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/kg/min) were administered as 1-minute pulses every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. The number of contractions per pulse (contraction/pulse ratio) was used to determine differences in myometrial responsiveness.RESULTS: Before dexamethasone infusion there was a circadian rhythm in uterine activity with peak contractile events between 8 and 10 PM (p < 0.01), whereas during infusion the rhythm was ablated. At oxytocin dose 1, the 9 AM contraction/pulse ratio (0.3 +/- 0.1) was lower than that for 9 PM (0.6 +/- 0.2) and for 60 hours later (0.6 +/- 0.1) (mean +/- SE, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed at dose 2, whereas no differences in the contraction/pulse ratio were noted at dose 3. Basal plasma oxytocin concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone treatment, whereas plasma estradiol and cortisol concentrations were reduced compared with control values (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is a differential sensitivity to oxytocin between morning and evening and (2) the dexamethasone-induced loss of the uterine contractile rhythm is not the result of a loss of myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin or to a suppression of plasma oxytocin concentrations.", "label": 0}

He lives with his parents in a small resort town approximately 90 miles outside a major city. Both his parents are professionals in their late 30s and have been highly involved in his care since birth. At the 12-month visit, they were concerned about his difficulty regulating. He was not sleeping through the night and had significant difficulty with baths. His physical examination and growth were normal. His eye contact was good, although it was difficult to see him smile. He had 1 or 2 words and was beginning to walk independently.At the 15-month checkup, they continued to be concerned about his poor regulation. He napped sporadically, and he was very difficult to take out on errands as he did not like his car seat. He now had approximately 10 single words, was using his fingers to point, and very clearly waved \"bye bye\" as soon as you entered the room.At the 18-month checkup, they state that he has not yet learned the word \"no.\" He will follow a 1-step command when he wants to but now has 15 single words without any combinations. He points for his needs and to show them something. He has become increasingly \"shy\" around strangers and prefers to play with one other child as opposed to a larger group. He does not like loud noises and prefers to go barefoot constantly. His physical examination was again normal as was his growth. He is referred for a full hearing evaluation, which is also normal. The family was referred to early intervention, and he began receiving speech and language therapy and occupational therapy for his sensory challenges as well as a play group.At the 24-month checkup, his language continued to consist of single words-now approximately 30. When the parents do not understand what he wants, he will often tantrum and has started banging his head on the floor when frustrated. He has no repetitive behaviors and is starting to demonstrate imaginative play. Bath time has becoming increasingly challenging because he does not like the sensation of soap and the water temperature must be \"just right.\" You refer the child to a Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrician for evaluation and at 28 months he is seen. During his testing visit, he had decreased eye contact and followed his own agenda but improved significantly as testing progressed. As he got more comfortable, he began making good eye contact, social referenced, and exhibited joint attention with his parents and the examiner. He did not meet criteria for an autism spectrum disorder or specifically pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). He was given a diagnosis of mixed receptive and expressive language delay and disruptive behavior disorder with sensory processing problems.The parents come to you a month after their evaluation visit asking you to give him a \"listed diagnosis of PDD-NOS\" that could be removed when he turns 3 years so that he may qualify for increased hours of services-up to 15 hours per week-as well as applied behavioral analysis therapy. A behavioral therapist through early intervention has told the family that he would benefit from this increased intervention, specifically applied behavioral analysis but the only way he can receive it is with a \"medical diagnosis\" on the autism spectrum.

The clinical features and treatments of this patient were analyzed.RESULTS: (1) A 43 years old male of South Korean nationality was admitted with the complaint of back ache for 7 days and fever 2 days with the following characteristics: back ache 7 days ago, without fever or cough or expectoration. He had been suspected to suffer from infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) by the Disease Control Department of South Korea, but no specific treatment was given. He had fever for 2 days with maximum body temperature of 39.7 centigrade. He had no chills, cough, expectoration, short of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, frequent micturition, or urgency or pain of urination, and no sore throat. The patient had a history of exposure to MERS-CoV patient. He was considered to be a patient of the second batch of South Korean epidemic. (2) Auxiliary examination: 3 copies of throat swab specimens for virus nucleic acid detection were performed by the Disease Prevention Control Center of China ( China CDC ), and they were positive on May 29th, 2015, and also for serum, sputum and stool. Based on the results of whole genome sequence analysis, the virus strains were implicated to be derived from Riyahh and Jeddah regions of Saudi Arabia. On admission, the patient's blood test showed that the white blood cell count was low ( 3.22?10(9)/L ), the proportion of the neutrophils was high ( 0.73 ), and that of the platelet was low ( 81?10(9)/L ). On admission, the patient's chest X-ray showed that a small amount of infiltration in the lung. (3) TREATMENT: a high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) with oxygen concentration of 0.50-0.80 was given, with a flow rate was set at 60 L/min if tolerated. It was changed to a low flow oxygen inhalation nasal cannula on the 20th day, and oxygen treatment was stopped on the 24th day. Ribavirin 2.0 g was given as the first dose, and was switched to 600 mg every 8 h ( q8h ), and it was reduced to 600 mg q12h after 10 days, and extenuated since the 13th day. Ceftriaxone was added on the 4th day with 2.0 g a day , and it was changed to meropenem 2.0 g, q8h on the 7th day for 2 weeks. Gamma globulin was given for 7 days ( 20 g, qd ). Thymosin-1 was given on the 8th day for 2 weeks. Interferon was given once a week, but only one dose was used. At the same time symptomatic treatment such as methimazole and liver protection therapy were given. (4) Patient began to cough at admission, and it disappeared on the 18th day. There was no sputum at first, then a small amount of sputum with a little blood appeared after the admission. Then there was cough without sputum. Mild shortness of breath and diarrhea after exertion were noticed. He had no chest pain, difficulty in breathing or other symptoms. There was dullness on percussion in both sides of chest, and it disappeared gradually. Fine moist rales were detectable in scapular area and interscapular area on the 5th day, and they disappeared after 3 days. Breath sounds on both sides was weak, and it became more obvious in the right lung after 5 days, and returned to normal after 18 days. He had a sustaining fever for 1 week with the maximum temperature of 39.5 centigrade, then the body temperature returned to normal. The viral nucleic acid test as performed by the Center for Disease Control of Guangdong ( CDC, Guangdong ) showed that the pharyngeal swab cultured turned negative on the 3rd day, that of serum specimens turned negative on the 8th day, that of stool specimen after 2 weeks, and it was persistently positive for sputum culture until 5 days before discharge. The oxygenation index gradually increased, and it was over 300 mmHg ( 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa ) after 15 days. Pleural effusion was rapidly increased during the first week as shown by chest X-ray films, and it began to be absorbed gradually in the second week, but it was not completely absorbed until discharge.CONCLUSIONS: The disease course of the reported patient was short, with an acute onset, with fever as the chief complaint, but there were no respiratory symptoms, though there were high fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and other clinical symptoms after admission. Virus in sputum disappeared after treatment, but pleural effusion was not completely absorbed. Negative test for virus in sputum was late, indicating that clearance of virus was slow from the lungs. It is the first case of MERS in China, therefore, the clinical manifestations and the treatment strategy need to be further explored.", "label": 0}

A 0.6 ? 0.5 cm Nottingham grade 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma was removed from the right upper outer quadrant, margins were free of tumor, and there was no angiolymphatic invasion. The six dissected lymph nodes were negative for malignancy. Her surgical history was otherwise unremarkable. Her medical history was positive for hypercholesterolemia and depression. Pertinent family history included breast cancer in both her mother and her sister. Given the patient's age, tumor size, lack of nodal involvement, and clear surgical margins, she met recommended MammoSite criteria, and she underwent accelerated partial breast radiation. She subsequently received 340 cGy of radiation twice a day for a total dose of 3400 cGy in 10 administrations in February 2005. Accelerated partial breast radiation treatment was completed in February 2005, and she received subsequent routine care. Prior to 2014, the only postoperative complication was a chronic radiation bed seroma, which required periodic percutaneous drainage. She did not develop postsurgical lymphedema. In December 2013, 9 years after accelerated partial breast radiation treatment, she experienced progressive painful pruritic breast fullness, skin dimpling, and skin discoloration of the mastectomy scar and radiation bed. She sought medical care in January 2014 after she noticed a periareolar ulcerating skin plaque, more noticeable nipple retraction, and new onset of retroareolar aching. At physical examination ( Fig 1 ), there was generalized periareolar erythema, dimpling, firmness, and fixation involving the central breast and right upper outer quadrant. There was more conspicuous retraction of the nipple when compared with that seen at prior examinations. Nipple discharge was not present. There was a 1-cm periareolar ulcerating skin plaque.

We report a phosgene exposure that resulted in the patient's death.CASE REPORT: A 58 year-old man arrived to the emergency department 1 hour after exposure to phosgene with complaints of a sore throat. Initial vital signs were blood pressure 175/118 mmHg, heart rate 98/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Physical exam revealed few scattered rhonchi, without signs of distress. Initial arterial blood gases (ABG's) revealed pH 7.42, pCO2 43 mmHg, pO2 68 mmHg, HCO3 27 meq/L, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Initial chest x-ray 2 hours after the exposure demonstrated clear lung fields. Approximately 2.5 hours after the exposure, he began complaining of dyspnea, restlessness and his oxygen saturation dropped below 90%. He received nebulized albuterol, 1 gram intravenous methylprednisolone, and 100 % oxygen via face mask. Minimal improvement was noted and he was intubated. The post intubation chest x-ray, 3.5 hours after the exposure, revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Acetylcysteine, terbutaline, and IV steroids were administered without improvement. The patient died 30 hours after exposure.DISCUSSION: There are many misunderstandings concerning phosgene due to its rare presentation. Traditional treatment modalities are often unproven in human trials and were unsuccessful in this case.CONCLUSION: This case highlights the significant toxicity that results from phosgene exposure and the challenges of the limited treatment modalities.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of pregnancy outcome in women over age 50 who conceived using donor oocytes. This study presents the pregnancy and delivery data on two women who delivered at age 52.CASES: Case 1 was a 51-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, whose three children had been conceived with her first husband more than 20 years previously. She had remarried 18 years before presentation and had been actively trying to conceive for the last 7 years. She was diagnosed as being in menopause based on elevated gonadotropins, amenorrhea, and failure to have progesterone-withdrawal menses. She conceived on her first embryo transfer cycle with embryos derived from donor oocytes and fertilized by her husband's sperm (oocytes were donated by a woman who was undergoing retrieval for in vitro fertilization). During pregnancy she remained healthy, but had uterine prolapse at 20 weeks. She delivered a normal healthy male at 40.5 weeks; cesarean was performed because of a presumptive diagnosis of fetal distress after 3 hours of labor, when monitoring revealed fetal heart decelerations. Case 2 was also a 51-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 4, who wished to conceive with her second husband's sperm through the donor oocyte program. She had amenorrhea of 2 years' duration and elevated gonadotropins. Conception occurred after fertilization of a donor oocyte by her husband's sperm. She had an uneventful pregnancy, but labor was induced at 38 weeks' gestation given the supposed high-risk status of this age group. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.CONCLUSION: Theoretically, the risks of pregnancy complications in older patients are magnified given the aging maternal cardiovascular system, which may predispose these women to placental insufficiency. These first two cases of donor oocyte pregnancies in women over age 50 found no maternal or fetal age-related complications. We hope these reports will encourage all researchers to share their findings so that prospective patients can make better, more informed decisions as to whether they want to participate in donor oocyte programs.", "label": 0}

Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 15.3 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 7,900/mm3\nPlatelet count 223,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.6 mEq/L\nCl- 103 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 14 mg/dL\nGlucose 90 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nPlasma metanephrines 1.2 nmol/L (N < 0.5 nmol/L)\nUrine toxicology screening is positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Based on the following findings, patient was given phenoxybenzamine. Renal doppler showed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a mass in the left adrenal gland. ", "knowledge": "We report a 91-year-old man who had a stroke and died of renal failure. He had been treated for hypertension since 20 years before the onset of the present illness. In addition, he was operated on a gastric cancer 17 years previously. Otherwise he was doing well until May 29, 1991 (when he was 87-year-old) when he had sudden onset of dysarthria and right facial weakness. He was admitted to our hospital. On admission, general physical examination was unremarkable, and neurologic examination revealed a mentally sound man with slight dysarthria, right facial weakness, orolingual dyskinesia, and dysequilibrium in which he showed difficulty in tandem gait; however, no cerebellar ataxia was noted. A cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis with multiple low density areas in the cerebral white matter. His BUN was 37 mg/dl and Cr 2.2 mg/dl. His neurologic symptoms cleared within the next few weeks and he was discharged with ticlopidine 100 mg q.d.. He had been doing well after the discharge except for gradual worsening of his renal function; his BUN was 65 mg/dl and Cr 3.27 mg/dl in April of 1994. On March 10, 1995, he fell down and hit his back; he became unable to walk because of pain, and he was admitted again on March 16, 1995. On admission, his blood pressure was 170/80 mmHg. There was an 1 + pitting pretibial edema; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed an alert and oriented man, however, Hasegawa's dementia scale was 23/30. Higher cerebral functions as well as cranial nerves were intact. He showed some unsteadiness of gait, however, no motor weakness or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, but Chaddock sign was positive bilaterally. Vibration was diminished in the feet, however, pain and touch sensations were intact. Laboratory examination revealed a compression fracture of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Blood count and chemistries were as follows; Hb 7.6 g/dl, Hct 23.3%, TP 6.0 g/dl, Alb 3.6 g/dl, BUN 87 mg/dl, Cr 4.53 mg/dl, T-Chol 174 mg/dl, HDL-Chol 49 mg/dl, Glu 156 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, K 5.4 mEq/L, Cl 115 mEq/L. A urine specimen contained 1 + protein and 1 + glucose, and the sediments contained hyaline casts. A cranial CT scan was essentially same as that taken four years ago. His hospital course was complicated with pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and progressive renal failure. He was treated with intravenous fluid, chemotherapy, and other supportive measures, however, he expired from respiratory failure on April 30, 1995. He was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had Binswanger's disease in the brain, benign nephrosclerosis from arteriolosclerosis due to hypertension, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. Opinions were divided regarding the question as to whether or not this patient had Binswanger's disease. Although his cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis, his dementia and gait disturbance was only mild until his fall on March, 1995. Clinical features did not conform to those of Binswanger's disease. Postmortem examination of the right hemisphere revealed wide spread atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. The kidney showed benign nephrosclerosis due to arteriolosclerosis. Sclerotic changes were also seen in the coronary arteries and the left middle cerebral artery with 70% stenosis. Myelin stain showed diffuse myelin pallor of the cerebral white matters with scattered small infarcts. Arterioles in the white matter showed arteriolosclerosis. Small infarcts were also seen in the putamen and in the thalamus. This patient appeared to have had circulatory disturbance of the white matter which is the basic abnormality causing Binswanger's disease. However, white matter changes in this patient were not quite severe enough to make a pathologic diagnosis of Binswanger's disease.", "label": 1}

Since he inhaled vaporized bromine and had dyspnea and pharyngalgia, he arrived at our hospital in an ambulance as an emergency patient. On arrival, he kept a clear consciousness with a pulse rate of 98, body temperature of 36.8 degrees C, blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25, and oxygen saturation of 100%. (10 L/min of oxygen were administered.) He had marked dry coughs. His clothes had a foreign odor with mucosal irritation. Arterial blood gas analysis and blood biochemistry were normal. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with chemical airway damage and bulbar conjunctiva from the exposure to bromine and a chemical burn on the right forearm. His respiratory condition became worse after admission, resulting in pulmonary edema. He was endotracheally intubated and controlled with an artificial ventilator on Day 3 after his injury. He was continuously treated with steroids and sivelestat sodium hydrate, which gradually improved his respiration. He was released from the artificial ventilator and extubated on Day 7. Although dyspnea associated with body movement and hoarseness persisted after extubation, the symptoms decreased and he was discharged on Day 41. This rare case is worth attention because serious respiratory insufficiency requiring artificial ventilation due to pulmonary edema from bromine exposure has not been reported in Japan.", "label": 0}

The mechanism of action of this centrally acting muscle relaxant is unknown; however, the observation of serotonin syndrome in patients with metaxalone overdose suggests a role in the serotonergic pathway.CASE REPORT: (Case 1) A 29-year-old woman with overdose of metaxalone presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, seizure-like activity, hyperthermia, rigidity in the lower extremities, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Vital signs on arrival include blood pressure of 168/80 mmHg, heart rate of 208 beats per minute (bpm), respirations of 20/min, a temperature of 41.6 C rectally, and room air oxygen saturation of 97%. She was intubated and sedated with benzodiazepines, and actively cooled. Serum paroxetine concentration was 23 (therapeutic range: 20-200) ng/mL, and serum metaxalone concentration was 31 mcg/mL (peak plasma concentrations average 0.9 mcg/mL at 3.3 h following a single oral dose of 400 mg). (Case 2) A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, rigidity in his lower extremities, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Vital signs on arrival include blood pressure of 158/131 mmHg, heart rate of 126 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2C, with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His medication list included metaxalone and escitalopram. He was managed aggressively with IV boluses of diazepam, in total 80 mg, in the emergency department. Serum escitalopram concentration was 24 ng/mL with a therapeutic range of 21-64 ng/mL, and serum metaxalone concentration was 58 mcg/mL.CONCLUSION: These two cases suggest that at supratherapeutic concentrations metaxalone has serotonergic effects.

Volunteers with patellofemoral pain met the following criteria: knee pain greater than or equal to 3 cm on a 10-cm visual analog scale, insidious onset of symptoms not related to trauma, pain with palpation of the patellar facets, and knee pain during 2 of the following activities: stair climbing, jumping or running, squatting, kneeling, or prolonged sitting. Control participants were excluded if they had a prior history of patellofemoral pain, knee surgery in the past 2 years, or current lower extremity injury that limited participation in physical activity.INTERVENTION(S): Concentric and eccentric torque of the hip musculature was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer. All volunteers performed 5 repetitions of each strength test. Separate multivariate analyses of variance were performed to compare concentric and eccentric torque of the hip extensors, abductors, and external rotators between groups.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Average and peak concentric and eccentric torque of the hip extensors, abductors, and external rotators. Torque measures were normalized to the participant's body weight multiplied by height.RESULTS: The patellofemoral pain group was weaker than the control group for peak eccentric hip abduction torque (F(1,38) = 6.630, P = .014), and average concentric (F(1,38) = 4.156, P = .048) and eccentric (F(1,38) = 4.963, P = .032) hip external rotation torque.CONCLUSIONS: The patellofemoral pain group displayed weakness in eccentric hip abduction and hip external rotation, which may allow for increased hip adduction and internal rotation during functional movements.", "label": 1}

During the study period, we identified 21 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of abruptio placentae. In addition, we enrolled two groups of patients whose pregnancies were not complicated by placental abruption (28 preterm controls and 53 term controls).RESULTS: Mean maternal serum levels of CA 125 were significantly higher among women with abruptio placentae (40.6 +/- 29.6 U/mL) than among preterm controls (26.6 +/- 17.2 U/mL) or term controls (22.0 +/- 11.4 U/mL). Using a positive threshold of 35 U/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of maternal serum CA 125 for abruptio placentae were 42.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.7-64.1) and 92.5% (95% CI 85.4-99.6), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an earlier report documenting higher mean maternal serum levels of CA 125 among women with pregnancies complicated by abruptio placentae than in control subjects.

Participants with an ejection fraction >40% in the prospective CHARM Echocardiographic Substudy were included in this analysis.

Clinical characteristics were recorded, and systolic and diastolic function were evaluated by echocardiography. The primary substudy outcome was the composite of CV mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and myocardial infarction or stroke. A total of 181 patients were included, and there were 17 primary CV events (9.4%) during a median follow-up time of 524 days. In a model including clinical characteristics, echocardiographic measures, and BNP or NT-proBNP, the composite CV event outcome was best predicted by NT-proBNP >300 pg/ml (hazard ratio 5.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.3 to 26.4, p = 0.02) and moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography. When NT-proBNP >600 pg/ml was used in the model, it was the sole independent predictor of primary CV events (hazard ratio 8.0, 95% CI 2.6 to 24.8, p = 0.0003) as was BNP >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio 3.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.2, p = 0.02) in the BNP model.

He was admitted to the ophthalmology service of our hospital on April 9, 1990, and neurological consultation was asked on April 11. Neurologic examination revealed alert and oriented man without dementia. Higher cerebral functions were intact. He had bilateral large visual field defects with loss of vision; he was only able to count the digit number with his right eye and to recognize hand movement with his left eye. Otherwise neurologic examination was unremarkable. General physical examination was also unremarkable; he had no hypertension. Cranial CT scan was normal on April 11; lumber spinal fluid contained 1 cell/microliter, 63 mg/dl of sugar, and 97 mg/dl of protein; myelin basic protein was detected, however, oligoclonal bands were absent. He was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and oral steroid, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. He started to show gaze paresis to left, ideomotor apraxia, agnosia of the body, and dementia. Cranial CT scan on June 11 revealed a low density area in the deep left parietal white matter facing the trigonal area of the lateral ventricle. He was discharged on July 2, 1990. Hasegawa dementia scale was 2/32.5 upon discharge. In the subsequent course, he showed improvement in his mental capacity and Hasegawa dementia scale was 22.5/32.5 in 1991, however, no improvement was noted in his vision. In 1994, he started to show mental decline in that he became disoriented, and showed delusional ideation of self persecution and depersonalization with occasional confusional state. He also showed unsteady gait. Cranial MRI on February 13, 1996 revealed a T2-high signal intensity lesion on each side of the parietal deep white matter more on the left and another T2-high signal intensity lesion in the left pons as well as in the right thalamus. He complained of right hypochondrial pain and was admitted to another hospital on April 22, 1996. He was markedly confused and demented. He continued to show bilateral loss of vision, but no motor palsy was noted. Cranial CT scan on April 23, 1996 revealed diffuse cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation in addition to the low density areas in both parietal deep white matter. He developed jaundice in the middle of May. Abdominal CT scan revealed multiple low-to iso-density areas in the liver and marked iso-to high-density swelling of the right kidney. The patient expired on June 9th, 1996. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had had a carcinomatous limbic encephalitis with optic neuropathy and a choleduct carcinoma. Other opinions entertained included acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with optic neuritis, and granulomatous angiitis of the central nervous system. Some participants thought the primary site of the carcinoma was the right kidney with metastasis to the liver. Post mortem examination revealed a mixed type carcinoma in the right kidney with liver metastases. Neuropathologic examination revealed an incomplete softening in the optic chiasm and the left optic nerve, and in the left parieto-occipital areas.

During the years from 1998 to 2001, 70 cases of SIPE were documented in young healthy male subjects participating in a fitness-training program. Physical examination and pulse oximetry were performed immediately. Chest radiographs were obtained in all cases 12 to 18 h following onset of symptoms. In 37 swimmers, spirometry was performed at the time of chest radiography and again after 7 days.RESULTS: All subjects complained of severe shortness of breath. Sixty-seven of the 70 subjects (95.7%) had a prominent cough; in 63 subjects (90%), there was significant sputum production. Hemoptysis was observed in 39 subjects (55.7%). Mean arterial oxygen saturation after swimming was 88.4 +/- 6.6% breathing air, compared with 98 +/- 1.7% breathing air at rest before the start of the swimming trial (mean +/- SD) [p < 0.001].

We report the case of a 28-year old woman suffering from infertility and amenorrhea. Her weight was normal (BMI = 19) and she had no hirsutism. She self-reported food restriction and a 10 kg weight loss 5 years ago, concomitant with the onset of amenorrhea. At the initial evaluation, the patient was considered as having HA due to food restriction. At ultrasonography, ovaries were small and multifollicular (right and left area: 2.2 and 2.5 cm(2), respectively; number of cysts 2-9 mm in diameter: 15 and 12, respectively), and no stromal hypertrophy was noted. She has been treated for 1 month by intravenous pulsatile GnRH administration. Although the doses were increased from 5 to 15 microg/pulse every 90 min, no E2 response and no follicular development were observed. Hormonal re-evaluation revealed normal levels of serum LH, FSH and androgens, and a normal LH/FSH ratio. However, a typical aspect of PCO was found at ultrasound (right and left area: 6.5 and 5.5 cm(2), respectively, and more than 15 small cysts arranged peripherally around an increased central stroma in each ovary). The treatment has been then switched to hMG, using the low dose step-up regimen and starting with 75 U/day. In the absence of response after 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 112.5 U/day and a multifollicular reaction occurred, leading to cancellation. In conclusion, we hypothesize that this patient had a \"hidden\" PCOS when she was hypogonadotrophic and that it developed very rapidly after restitution of a normal gonadotropin level under exogenous GnRH. This occurred despite a low insulin level, showing that hyperinsulinism is not a prerequisite for the development of PCOS in every case.", "label": 1}

He was well until June of 1985 when he was 59-years-old when he had an acute onset of loss of vision in his right eye. He was treated by prednisolone with a complete remission. In August of 1986, he had another bout of blurring of vision in his left eye. Once he lost his left vision completely, from which he showed slow recovery. In January of 1987, he developed blurring of his right eye and loss of pain and touch sensation in his right leg. Since then he repeated loss of vision in his right or left eye five times, and he was admitted to our hospital in May of 1990. On admission, he was alert and oriented. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral optic nerve atrophy. He could not discriminate light or dark by either eye. Other cranial nerves were unremarkable. He could walk in a wide-base only with support; spasticity was noted in his left leg. Muscle strength was preserved. Deep reflexes were exaggerated in both legs with extensor plantar reflex bilaterally. Pain and touch sensation was decreased in the left leg by 30%, and vibration was diminished in both feet. Position sense was preserved. Routine blood counts and chemistries were unremarkable. Cranial MRI scans revealed multiple high-signal intensity lesions in both pontine bases, basal ganglia, thalami, and in the deep cerebral white matters. He was treated with oral prednisolone, plasmapheresis, lymphocytapheresis, and then immuran. His vision showed only slight recovery to discriminate light and dark. In October of 1990, slight weakness appeared in his both legs. In December of that year, he developed nausea, and a fiber colonoscopic study revealed a stenosis in the transverse colon. In March of 1991, he developed anemia and liver dysfunction. In July of that year, jaundice appeared, and his serum bilirubin was increased. In October, his leg weakness became more prominent, and his cranial CT scans at that time revealed a low density change in the right cerebellum in the right superior cerebellar artery territory; in addition, multiple low density spots were scattered to be seen in both cerebral hemispheres including the basal ganglia and thalamic areas with ventricular dilatation and cortical atrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "label": 1}

The disorder is included under anxiety disorders because it shares some obsessive-compulsive features. Patients have the tendency towards feelings of unattractiveness, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (1,2). It is a major psychiatric problem, but many patients with this disorder first present to a dermatologist. An 11-year-old girl came to our department with a 2-month history of diffuse hair loss on the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area (Figure 1). She had originally been examined by a pediatrician with the diagnosis of alopecia areata. The patient`s personal history included hay fever and shortsightedness, and she suffered from varicella and mononucleosis. Nobody in the family history suffered from alopecia areata, but her father has male androgenetic alopecia (Norwood/Hamilton MAGA C3F3). The mother noticed that the child had had changeable mood for about 2 months and did not want to communicate with other persons in the family. The family did not have any pet at home. At school, her favorite subjects were Math and Computer Studies. She did not like Physical Education and did not participate in any sport activities during her free time. This was very strange because she was obese (body-mass index (BMI) 24.69). She was sometimes angry with her 13-year-old sister who had better results at school. The girl had suddenly started to wear a blue scarf. The parents did not notice that she pulled out her hair at home. Dermatological examination of the capillitium found a zone of incomplete alopecia in the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area, without inflammation, desquamation, and scaring. Hairs were of variable length (Figure 1). There was a patch of incomplete alopecia above the forehead between two stripes of hair of variable length (Figure 2). The hair pull test was negative along the edges of the alopecia. Mycological examination from the skin capillitium was negative. The trichoscopy and skin biopsy of the parietotemporal region of the capillitium (Figure 3) confirmed trichotillomania. Laboratory tests (blood count, iron, ferritin, transferrin, selenium, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, serology and hormones of thyroid gland) were negative. We referred the girl for ophthalmologic and psychological examination. Ophthalmologic examination proved that there was no need to add any more diopters. The psychological examination provided us with a picture in which she drew her family (Figure 4). The strongest authority in the family was the mother because she looked after the girls for most of the day. She was in the first place in the picture. The father had longer working hours and spent more time outside the home. He worked as a long vehicle driver. He was in the second place in the picture. There was sibling rivalry between the girls, but the parents did not notice this problem and preferred the older daughter. She was successful at school and was prettier (slim, higher, curly brown hair, without spectacles). Our 11-years-old patient noticed all these differences between them, but at her level of mental development was not able to cope with this problem. She wanted to be her sister's equal. The sister is drawn in the picture in the third place next to father, while the patient's own figure was drawn larger and slim even though she was obese. Notably, all three female figures had very nice long brown hair. It seemed that the mother and our patient had better quality of hair and more intense color than the sister in the drawing. The only hairless person in the picture was the father. The girl did not want to talk about her problems and feelings at home. Then it was confirmed that our patient was very sensitive, anxious, willful, and withdrawn. She was interested in her body and very perceptive of her physical appearance. From the psychological point of view, the parents started to pay more interest to their younger daughter and tried to understand and help her. After consultation with the psychiatrist, we did not start psychopharmacologic therapy for trichotillomania; instead, we started treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, mild shampoo, mild topical steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%) in solution and methionine in capsules. With parents' cooperation, the treatment was successful. The name trichotillomania was first employed by the French dermatologist Francois Henri Hallopeau in 1889, who described a young man pulling his hair out in tufts (3-5). The word is derived from the Greek thrix (hair), tillein (to pull), and mania (madness) (5). The prevalence of TTM in the general adult population ranges from 0.6% to 4%, and 2-4% of the general psychiatric outpatient population meet the criteria for TTM (2-5). The prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at less than 1% (5). The disease can occur at any age and in any sex. The age of onset of hair pulling is significantly later for men than for women (3). There are three subsets of age: preschool children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. The mean age of onset is pre-pubertal. It ranges from 8 to 13 years (on average 11.3 years) (2-5). The occurrence of hair-pulling in the first year of life is a rare event, probably comprising <1% of cases (5). The etiology of TTM is complex and may be triggered by a psychosocial stressor within the family, such as separation from an attachment figure, hospitalization of the child or parent, birth of a younger sibling, sibling rivalry, moving to a new house, or problems with school performance. It has been hypothesized that the habit may begin with \"playing\" with the hair, with later chronic pulling resulting in obvious hair loss (2). Environment is a factor because children usually pull their hair when alone and in relaxed surroundings. The bedroom, bathroom, or family room are \"high-risk\" situations for hair-pulling (5). Men and women also differed in terms of the hair pulling site (men pull hair from the stomach/back and the moustache/beard areas, while women pull from the scalp) (3). Pulling hair from siblings, pets, dolls, and stuffed animals has also been documented, often occurring in the same pattern as in the patient (5). Genetic factors contributing to the development of TTM are mutations of the SLITRK1 gene, which plays a role in cortex development and neuronal growth. The protein SAPAP3 has been present in 4.2% of TTM cases and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be involved in the development of the spectrum of OCD. A significantly different concordance rate for TTM was found in monozygotic (38.1%) compared with dizygotic (0%) twins in 34 pairs (3). The core diagnostic feature is the repetitive pulling of hairs from one`s own body, resulting in hair loss. The targeted hair is mostly on the scalp (75%), but may also be from the eyebrows (42%), eyelashes (53%), beard (10%), and pubic area (17%) (3,5). There are three subtypes of hair pulling - early onset, automatic, and focused. Diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV criteria are (2,3,5): 1) recurrent pulling of one`s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss; 2) an increasing sense of tension immediately prior to pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior; 3) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair; 4) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g., a dermatologic condition); 5) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The differential diagnosis includes alopecia areata (Table 1) (6), tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, secondary syphilis, traction alopecia, loose anagen syndrome, lichen planopilaris, alopecia mucinosa, and scleroderma (2-5). Biopsy of an involved area (ideally from a recent site of hair loss) can help to confirm the diagnosis (5). On histologic examination, there are typically increased numbers of catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation. Chronic hair pulling induces a catagen phase, and more hairs will be telogen hairs. Pigment casts and empty anagen follicles are often seen. Perifollicular hemorrhage near the hair bulb is an indicator of TTM (2). Complications of TTM are rare, but they comprise secondary bacterial infections with regional lymphadenopathy as a result of picking and scratching at the scalp. Many patients play with and ingest the pulled hairs (e.g. touching the hair to lips, biting, and chewing). Trichophagia (ingestion of the hair) can lead to a rare complication named trichobezoar (a \"hair ball\" in stomach). This habit is present in approximately 5% to 30% of adult patients, but it is less frequent in children. Patient with trichophagia present with pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Radiologic examination and gastroscopy should not be delayed (2,4,5). The management of the disease is difficult and requires strong cooperation between the physician, patient, and parents. The dermatologist cannot take part in the therapy, strictly speaking, but without the psychological, psychopharmacologic, and topic dermatologic treatment a vicious circle will be perpetuated.

She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling \"sad and anxious.\" Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation.

She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her \"poison.\" She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel \"safe.\" She claimed to have an \"entity inside of her body who was a bully\" and who was \"taking over her body\" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act \"more like herself\"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition to individual Dialectical Behavior Therapy, finally led to improvement of mood and a gradual return of her normal baseline, with reportedly stable emotional, social, and academic functioning.The patient's mother remained convinced that this adolescent's mood instability was caused by underlying hormonal problems so you refer her to endocrinology. Beth developed puberty at age 8, with menses occurring on average of twice yearly. She was found to have elevated free testosterone level of 8.6 (reference range, 1.2-7.5). She was of normal weight (body mass index = 21.85 kg/m) and did not manifest acne, male pattern hair thinning, or hirsutism. Thyroid functions, 17-OH progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone, and estradiol were within normal limits. Prolactin elevation (46.3) was assumed to be due to Risperidone. Patient refused ovarian ultrasound.After starting oral contraceptives to establish monthly menses, patient's emotional and behavioral symptoms continue to remain stable. After Beth decided on her own to discontinue psychotropic medications, she continued for 17 months following her initial visit to remain free of neuropsychiatric symptoms.Now that her symptoms seem resolved; you wonder what the medical diagnosis for Beth was? You wonder if \"hormones\" may have caused or contributed to her psychiatric presentation.", "label": 0}

Dabigatran does not require laboratory monitoring and its kinetics allow for a more rapid onset of action with a time to peak concentration of 1.25-1.5 h. We are reporting a fatality resulting from gastrointestinal bleeding after the ingestion of a single dose of dabigatran 150 mg.CASE DETAILS: A 92-year-old man with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and atrial flutter presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness and rectal bleeding. He was seen by his Cardiologist the day before and was found to be in new atrial fibrillation. He was prescribed dabigatran 150 mg twice daily for anticoagulation therapy. He took one dose of dabigatran 150 mg at 2200 and woke up the following morning before 0900 with profuse rectal bleeding. The initial vital signs in the emergency department, approximately 11 h after ingestion, were heart rate 72 beats/min, blood pressure 62/30 mmHg, and lab work showed hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL, international normalization ratio (INR) 1.99, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 66 mg/dL, and creatinine (SCr) 1.4 mg/dL (creatinine clearance (CrCl) 24.2 mL/min). He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids, two units of packed red blood cells, two units of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and vitamin K 10 mg intravenously. He was also given an unknown dose of erythromycin early in his hospital stay. An actively bleeding gastric ulcer was discovered and treated with local epinephrine injections. Approximately 48 h after his exposure, he received an additional two units of blood to treat his decreasing blood pressure (98/41 mmHg). On day three, his hemoglobin and hematocrit were stable at 10 g/dL and 30%, INR 1.6, he was extubated and off vasoactive medications. Day six of hospitalization, he began having maroon stools, his hemoglobin decreased to 8.1 g/dL and his platelets to 81 ? 1000/mcL. On day seven, the hemoglobin decreased to 6.4 mg/dL. Despite aggressive resuscitative efforts and supportive care, he died.DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates the potential of a single dose of dabigatran 150 mg to result in a fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This patient was started on the maximum dose with a CrCl 33.9 mL/min and on admission CrCl 24.2 mL/min, suggesting underlying renal insufficiency.", "label": 1}

In addition to anticholinergic and antihistaminergic effects, sodium channel blockade becomes evident following diphenhydramine overdose. While seizures may occur following overdose of a diphenhydramine, status epilepticus is distinctly uncommon. We report a case with both status epilepticus and wide-complex dysrhythmias following an intentional diphenhydramine overdose.CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old woman with a medical history of hypothyroidism on levothyroxine was brought to the emergency department with active seizures by emergency medical services after what was later determined to be a diphenhydramine overdose. One hour after an argument with her husband he found her lethargic in a locked room. Initial vital signs were: blood pressure, 90/55 mmHg; heart rate, 160 beats/min; respiratory rate 18 breaths/min; room air oxygen saturation, 99%; temperature, 99.8F; rapid point-of-care glucose, 130 mg/dL. The generalized seizures continued for duration of 30 min, despite the intravenous administration of 8 mg of lorazepam. The patient underwent endotracheal intubation and a propofol infusion terminated her seizures. An electrocardiogram after the status was terminated which revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with QRS duration of 127 ms. The QRS narrowed after 200 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate was administrated. The patient was neurologically intact upon extubation on hospital day 2. The serum diphenhydramine concentration drawn on arrival to the ED was 1200 ng/mL (9-120 ng/mL); a tricyclic screen was negative.DISCUSSION: While seizures and sodium channel blockade are recognized complications of diphenhydramine toxicity, reported cases of status epilepticus from diphenhydramine overdose are rare. Elements of the patient's presentation were similar to a tricyclic overdose and management required aggressive control of her seizures, sodium bicarbonate therapy, and recognizing that physostigmine was contraindicated due to wide complex tachycardia.CONCLUSIONS: Diphenhydramine overdose may cause status epilepticus and wide-complex tachycardia. Management should focus on antidotal therapy with sodium bicarbonate and supportive neurological management with appropriate anticonvulsants and airway protection if clinically indicated.", "label": 0}

He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications.He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose. During his psychiatric hospital stay, care coordination succeeded in arranging center-based applied behavior analysis interventions and respite care and parent training for his family. Sam began to show improvement in his overall agitation and aggression, requiring less clonazepam, and his mother then maintained outpatient follow-up.The day before discharge, you visit him in the hospital, and a medical student asks you why he was in the hospital for so long.

", "knowledge": "PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The hybrid capture human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assay is offered by the manufacturer to assist clinicians with patients with ASCUS pap smear results to assess the risk factor and to potentially direct follow-up of these patients. In our practice, a gynecologic oncology practice that has a referral based population with abnormal pap smears, our purpose was to evaluate the patients referred with all grades of abnormal cervical cytology.METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients who were referred for evaluation of abnormal cervical cytology: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL); high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL); or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were evaluated by repeat pap smear, hybrid capture HPV DNA analysis and colposcopy. Colposcopic findings were recorded, and if appropriate, cervical biopsies were performed. Hybrid capture results were correlated with histologic and cytologic findings. Using histopathologic diagnosis as the reference standard, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of pap smear and high risk HPV were calculated. The Kappa test was used to correlate colposcopic and histopathologic findings.RESULTS: Repeat pap smears at the time of initial consultation demonstrated 25 patients with normal results, 39 with LGSIL, 30 with HGSIL, 1 SCC and 5 ASCUS. Seventy-eight patients underwent cervical biopsy. Colposcopic findings correlated significantly with histopathologic findings (p<0.0001). Forty-four percent of patients tested positive for HPV DNA: 40 patients with high risk HPV, three patients with low risk HPV, and one patient with both high risk and low risk HPV. Sixteen of 39 patients (41%) with LGSIL on pap smear tested positive for high risk HPV; 37% of patients in this group required cervical conization because cervical biopsies demonstrated moderate/severe dysplasia. The diagnosis of moderate/severe dysplasia significantly correlated with the presence of high risk HPV [OR 78.9 (8.31-389.30)]. There was no significant correlation between the HPV DNA signal strengths and the histologic grade of dysplasia. The sensitivity and the positive predictive value of pap smear alone in identifying moderate/severe dysplasia was 62% and 96%, respectively. The combination of HGSIL pap smears and high risk HPV increased the sensitivity but not the positive predictive value for the detection of moderate/severe dysplasia to 77.7% and 95%, respectively (P=NS).CONCLUSIONS: Although in this setting, the use of hybrid capture DNA testing did not significantly improve the sensitivity or positive predictive value of the diagnosis of HGSIL cytology when compared to cytologically indicated plus colposcopically directed cervical biopsies in this population of women at high risk for the presence of disease, the combination of HGSIL pap smears and high-risk HPV did result in a clinically important increase in the diagnosis of moderate/severe dysplasia.", "label": 0}

The results of the index PAP were 97 (81.5%) atypia and 22 (18.5%) squamous intraepithelial lesion low grade (SIL LG). The index PAP was the first abnormal PAP smear for 92 of the patients (77%); 27 had one or more previous abnormal PAP smears (18 atypia, 7 SIL LG, 2 SIL high grade [HG]), and 13 had been referred for colposcopy in the past. For 76 of 92 patients with atypia on index PAP (84%), the index PAP was the first abnormal PAP smear. Of these 76 patients, 51 had a second PAP smear: 27 (53%) were normal, 13 (25%) atypia, and 11 (22%) SIL LG. Sixty patients were referred to the colposcopy clinic, but only 37 actually kept the colposcopy appointment despite outreach. The only significant factor for obtaining colposcopy was a visit to the Adolescent Clinic after notification of the abnormal PAP smear result and before the colposcopy appointment; 79% of those who had a visit obtained colposcopy compared with 45% of those who did not have such a visit (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences by race, insurance status, age, PAP smear result, previous referral for colposcopy, or number of reminders with compliance with recommendations for repeat PAP smears or colposcopy.CONCLUSIONS: Although a sizable proportion of adolescents with abnormal PAP smears have significant pathology on repeat PAP smears, adolescents with abnormal PAP smears have a high failure rate in keeping appointments for follow-up PAP smears and colposcopy. Interventions that target all adolescents with abnormal PAP smears need to be designed and tested to aid follow-up.", "label": 1}

Femoral arterial and venous catheters were inserted; 5 mL/kg of 20% meconium in normal saline was instilled into the endotracheal tube. Animals were randomized to either ITPV or conventional ventilation, and settings were adjusted to maintain ideal blood gases, i.e., pH 7.35 to 7.45, PCO2 40 to 45 torr (5.3 to 6 kPa), PO2 80 to 100 torr (10.7 to 13.3 kPa), and SaO2 > or = 90%. Ventilatory settings were adjusted as needed to a maximum of: FIO2 1.0, peak inspiratory pressure 40 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, and respiratory rate 80 breaths/min.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arterial blood gases were taken every 30 mins for 4 hrs and ventilatory settings were adjusted to maintain optimal blood gases. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and arterial saturation were monitored continuously. The animals in the ITPV group had significantly lower peak inspiratory pressure at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hrs after meconium instillation (p < .018) and significantly lower mean airway pressure at 2, 3, and 4 hrs after meconium instillation (p < .03). The mean peak inspiratory pressure in the ITPV animals ranged from 17 +/- 2.7 cm H2O at baseline to 16.6 +/- 5.7 cm H2O at 4 hrs compared with 16.5 +/- 2.7 cm H2O at baseline to 31.8 +/- 9.1 cm H2O at 4 hrs in the conventionally ventilated animals (p < .04). The mean airway pressure ranged from 6.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg at baseline to 6.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg at 4 hrs in the ITPV group compared with 5.5 +/- 1.2 mm Hg at baseline to 10.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg at 4 hrs in the conventional ventilation group (p < .03). The lungs of the ITPV animals were less hemorrhagic and had less pathologic evidence of injury than the lungs of the conventionally ventilated animals.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ITPV can be used to effectively ventilate and oxygenate piglets with meconium aspiration syndrome at lower mean airway pressures and peak inspiratory pressures than conventional ventilation. This lower pressure causes less injury to the lungs of the animals.", "label": 0}

Physical examination and routine laboratory studies showed that the patient was characterized by asymptomatic hypertension in the presence of hypokalemia and increased urinary potassium excretion. Plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) were elevated and plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed, resulting in a considerable increase in the ratio of PAC to PRA. PAC was not normally suppressed by saline infusion (2 1/2h, iv). PRA remained suppressed and PAC did not rise after stimulation with iv injection of furosemide (40 mg) in combination with walking for 60 min. PAC was increased in response to ACTH injection (0.25 mg, iv) but not suppressed by dexamethasone administration (2 and 8 mg/day, po). PAC did not rise after iv infusion of angiotensin II (20 ng/kg/min for 30 min). Venous sampling showed that PAC was considerably elevated in the bilateral adrenal vein. CT and MRI demonstrated tumor mass in the bilateral adrenal gland and the remaining normal portion in the left adrenal gland. Scintigraphic imaging with 133I-aldosterol during dexamethasone suppression provided bilateral uptake in the adrenals. Oral administration of spironolactone (375 mg/day) suppressed blood pressure and elevated PRA and serum potassium. Elevated PCA and PRA levels as well as hypertension were corrected by right-total and left-subtotal adrenalectomy performed in March, 1991.

His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Lower leg cast was applied. ", "knowledge": "INTRODUCTION: Dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint is a rare injury. It occurs during a sports activity that includes rough twisting movements of the bent knee. The role of the proximal tibiofibular joint is to reduce torsional loads to the ankle, to distribute the bending moment of the outer side of tibia, and transfer the vertical load while standing. In the literature there is no larger series; only several cases of the proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation treated by different methods have been published so far.CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old male soccer player sustained an injury after he had joined the game without previous warming-up. He fell on his right side because of a sudden change of direction while his foot was fixed to the base. He felt a severe pain and had a sensation as if something had snapped in his right knee. Pain and swelling at the head of fibula were found by physical examination, which, however, did not reveal any pain, swelling and instability of the ankle or peroneal nerve palsy. The x-ray showed anterolateral dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint, Ogden type II. Since manual reposition in general anesthesia failed, open reduction internal fixation was performed and proximal tibiofibular joint was transfixed with a screw After the wound closure, the above-the-knee plaster cast was applied. The screw was extracted six weeks later, full weight bearing was allowed and he started with physical therapy. Four months after the injury he returned to sports activities. On the follow-up one year after the injury he had the full range of motion of the knee, no complains, and continued with active soccer playing. X-ray showed no signs of arthrosis of the proximal tibiofibular joint.CONCLUSION: The proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation may be the cause of the chronic pain of the knee so it has to be taken into account when making differential diagnosis in case of the pain at the lateral side of the knee. The key for making the accurate diagnosis is the technically correct X-ray of the injured knee compared with the opposite one, showing the displacement of fibular head. If manual reposition fails, open reduction internal fixation and screw transfixation of the proximal tibiofibular joint allow good results and fast return to sport activities.", "label": 1}

Among 545 women with symptoms of either increased vaginal discharge or vulvar pruritus or burning, only 155 (28%) had positive C albicans cultures, whereas bacterial vaginosis or other sexually transmitted infections were found in 288 (53%). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for positive C albicans culture included condom use, presentation after the 14th menstrual cycle day, sexual intercourse more than four times per month, recent antibiotic use, young age, past gonococcal infection, and absence of current gonorrhea or bacterial vaginosis. A clinical algorithm based on symptoms, signs, and selective use of wet mounts and cultures would have provided prompt treatment to 150 of 167 (90%) women with vulvovaginal candidiasis while minimizing the number of cultures performed.CONCLUSION: A simple algorithm using symptoms, signs, wet mounts, and selective cultures can identify 90% of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. In this STD clinic, vulvovaginal symptoms also require assessment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and cervical infection.", "label": 1}

She was prescribed furosemide 40 mg/d to treat a slight left cardiac insufficiency. On day 10 of admission, the patient developed left-sided weakness. Neurologic examination revealed left hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan of the head showed no abnormality. Approximately 90 minutes after onset of the neurologic deficit, the patient had a BP of 180/100 mm Hg in both arms, an irregular pulse >75 bpm, and normal heart sounds. The patient was transferred to the Neurovascular Unit. There were no cervical or femoral bruits in this patient. During neurologic examination, the patient was alert and showed no signs of major cognitive deficit. The neurologic examination did reveal, however, minor hemisphere syndrome with left spatial neglect. There was a left lower-facial paresis. Motor examination revealed normal bulk with diminished tone in the patient's left arm and leg. Although there were no physical signs of dehydration, laboratory results revealed moderate signs of dehydration (total protein, 91 g/L [indicating proteinemia]; sodium, 147 mmol [indicating hypernatremia]; and elevated hematocrit, 42.0%). Considering the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and the duration of the symptoms (<3 hours), IV rtPA was administered. Approximately 10 minutes after intravenous rtPA administration, the patient's BP was 210/110 mm Hg, and an IV bolus of urapidil (20 mg) was administered. Approximately 2 minutes following urapidil administration, the patient developed neurologic worsening indicated by left-sided hemiplegia. Her BP was 105/60 mm Hg. The IV rtPA was immediately discontinued and volume replacement was started for 20 minutes. IV rtPA was restarted after the patient remained hemodynamically stable (15 minutes after rtPA was restarted). Following intensive physiotherapy, the patient was discharged on anticoagulation with a favorable outcome. At her 6-month follow-up, the patient had fully recovered.CONCLUSION: We report a probable case of hypotension associated with IV bolus of urapidil administration during rtPA thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in an elderly patient also treated with diuretics.", "label": 1}

", "knowledge": "Jessica, a 14-year-old girl with a history of asthma, went to her pediatrician's office because of a persistent cough. She had been coughing for at least 3 months with occasional cough-free periods of less than a few days. The cough was nonproductive and was not accompanied by fever, rhinorrhea, or facial or chest pain. Jessica and her mother observed that the cough increased with exercise and typically was not present during sleep. She has used two metered-dose inhalers--albuterol and cromolyn--without any change in the cough pattern. For the past 5 years, Jessica has had mild asthma responsive to albuterol. She enjoys running on the cross-country team, soccer, and dancing. She is an average student and denies any change in academic performance. She has never been hospitalized or had an emergency department visit for asthma or pneumonia. There has been no recent travel or exposure to a person with a chronic productive cough, tobacco smoke, or a live-in pet. Jessica lives with her mother and younger sister in a 10-year-old, carpeted apartment without any evidence of mold or recent renovation. In the process of taking the history, the pediatrician noticed that Jessica coughed intermittently, with two or three coughs during each episode. At times, the cough was harsh; at other times, it was a quiet cough, as if she were clearing her throat. She was cooperative, without overt anxiety or respiratory distress. After a complete physical examination with normal findings, the pediatrician interviewed Jessica and her mother alone. Jessica's parents had been divorced for the past 6 years. She lived with her mother but visited her father, and his new family with two young children, every weekend. She spoke about this arrangement comfortably and said that she loved her father and mother but didn't like the tension she experienced at her father's home. \"I don't like adults arguing when kids are around.\" When asked why she thought the cough persisted so long, she commented in a neutral tone, \"I don't know. It's never been like this before.\" Jessica's pediatrician prescribed an inhaled steroid with the albuterol. When the cough did not respond after 1 week, he ordered a chest radiograph (normal) and a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative-negative), and he added montelukast (a leukotriene inhibitor) and monitored airway resistance with a peak flow meter. The cough persisted, and the peak flow recording showed normal airway resistance.

We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman referred to our Emergency Department because of palpitations. The initial ECG showed a non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a borderline QTc interval (450 ms). After admission, the patient experienced an episode of TdP that started after short-coupling interval (280 ms) between the last sinus beat and the ventricular premature beat (VPB). DC-shock restored sinus rhythm. Physical examination, exercise testing, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance were all normal, and she had no family history of sudden cardiac death. Baseline ECG showed sinus rhythm and unifocal VPBs with the same morphology of the VPB of TdP. The patient received an ICD and was treated medically with verapamil. She was discharged from the hospital on oral therapy with verapamil (240 mg/day), and she was free of recurrence 12 months later when an electrical storm occurred. The verapamil dose was therefore increased to 480 mg/day. Unifocal VPBs disappeared from her body surface ECG, and the subsequent 3-year follow-up was uneventful.", "label": 1}

Initial vital signs were: blood pressure, 90/55 mmHg; heart rate, 160 beats/min; respiratory rate 18 breaths/min; room air oxygen saturation, 99%; temperature, 99.8F; rapid point-of-care glucose, 130 mg/dL. The generalized seizures continued for duration of 30 min, despite the intravenous administration of 8 mg of lorazepam. The patient underwent endotracheal intubation and a propofol infusion terminated her seizures. An electrocardiogram after the status was terminated which revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with QRS duration of 127 ms. The QRS narrowed after 200 mEq of intravenous sodium bicarbonate was administrated. The patient was neurologically intact upon extubation on hospital day 2. The serum diphenhydramine concentration drawn on arrival to the ED was 1200 ng/mL (9-120 ng/mL); a tricyclic screen was negative.DISCUSSION: While seizures and sodium channel blockade are recognized complications of diphenhydramine toxicity, reported cases of status epilepticus from diphenhydramine overdose are rare. Elements of the patient's presentation were similar to a tricyclic overdose and management required aggressive control of her seizures, sodium bicarbonate therapy, and recognizing that physostigmine was contraindicated due to wide complex tachycardia.CONCLUSIONS: Diphenhydramine overdose may cause status epilepticus and wide-complex tachycardia.

She had had no attacks after the age of 20. A CT scan done around that time had apparently been normal. On this trek she had developed diarrhea which had been cured with norfloxacin 400 mg two times per day for 3 days. Two days later, while descending, she developed a grand mal seizure at an altitude of 3300 meters, after which she developed a classic postictal phase but gradually recovered.

The patient's menstrual periods had been regular since menarche at the age of 12 until she became amenorrheic at the age of 20. She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism. Pelvic examination revealed significant clitoromegaly but otherwise normal external and internal genitalia. Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Histological examination of her ovaries obtained at laparoscopy showed several primary follicles with mild infiltration of the stromal cells. No thickened tunica albuginea or cystic formation were observed. These findings did not support either polycystic ovary or hyperthecosis. Serum testosterone (T) levels were extremely high (7.1 ng/ml), while serum androstenedione levels were only slightly above normal range (3.1 ng/ml). Urine 17-KS excretion was slightly increased (6.1 mg/day), while 17-OHCS output was within normal range (4.0 mg/day). Basal serum LH and FSH levels were within normal range and LH pulse frequency was reduced to 1 in 4 hours. Administration of dexamethasone 1 mg/day for 2 days did not suppress circulating T and free T levels but lowered serum cortisol concentration and urine excretion of 17-OHCS. Blood glucose and insulin levels were within normal limits and their responses to oral glucose administration were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography as well as adrenal scintigraphy did not reveal any tumorous lesions in bilateral adrenals and ovaries. Administration of GnRH agonist, Buserelin 900 micrograms/day, suppressed circulating T concentrations to 0.7 ng/ml in 8 days, while it had no significant effects on DHEA and DHEA-S levels. After 16 weeks of Buserelin administration, ovulation was successfully induced by hMG administration. Cyclic estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy by Kaufmann's schedule for 2 cycles also suppressed serum T levels to normal, female range.

Both her weight and her height were below the 5th percentile, her breast development and pubic hair were consistent with Tanner stage 1, and she had mental retardation and atypical facies. Her gait was antalgic; no muscle atrophy or shortness in the affected leg was present. On laboratory investigation, thyroid function tests were concordant with primary hypothyroidism. Her bone age was estimated as 8 years. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed increased bone mineral density.

A cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis with multiple low density areas in the cerebral white matter. His BUN was 37 mg/dl and Cr 2.2 mg/dl. His neurologic symptoms cleared within the next few weeks and he was discharged with ticlopidine 100 mg q.d.. He had been doing well after the discharge except for gradual worsening of his renal function; his BUN was 65 mg/dl and Cr 3.27 mg/dl in April of 1994.

There was an 1 + pitting pretibial edema; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed an alert and oriented man, however, Hasegawa's dementia scale was 23/30. Higher cerebral functions as well as cranial nerves were intact. He showed some unsteadiness of gait, however, no motor weakness or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, but Chaddock sign was positive bilaterally. Vibration was diminished in the feet, however, pain and touch sensations were intact. Laboratory examination revealed a compression fracture of the twelfth thoracic vertebra.

Postmortem examination of the right hemisphere revealed wide spread atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. The kidney showed benign nephrosclerosis due to arteriolosclerosis. Sclerotic changes were also seen in the coronary arteries and the left middle cerebral artery with 70% stenosis. Myelin stain showed diffuse myelin pallor of the cerebral white matters with scattered small infarcts. Arterioles in the white matter showed arteriolosclerosis. Small infarcts were also seen in the putamen and in the thalamus.

One of the most dreaded complications of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is infective endocarditis. Cloxacillin is a common antibiotic prescribed for suspected staphylococcal infections and confirmed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infections. Prolonged use of cloxacillin may lead to neutropenia.CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old Sinhalese man presented to Teaching Hospital Kurunegala, Sri Lanka, complaining of a 3-week history of fever; he was found to have a pansystolic murmur over the apex of his heart. He had leukocytosis with predominant neutrocytosis. His C-reactive protein was 231\u2009mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 100\u2009mm/first hour. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography revealed prolapsed mitral valve with 7\u2009?\u200913\u2009mm vegetation over the posterior mitral valve. On the following day, three blood cultures became positive and were subsequently identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Intravenously administered cloxacillin 3\u2009g 6 hourly was started. Following day 24 of intravenously administered cloxacillin, our patient developed high spike fever. His total white blood cells were: 990/mm3 with 34% neutrophils and 22% eosinophils. His hemoglobin concentration was 9.5\u2009g/dL and platelet count remained normal (202\u2009?\u2009106/mm3). His C-reactive protein was 78\u2009mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 95\u2009mm/first hour, and he was otherwise comfortable, showing no signs of sepsis beside the high grade fever. His serum was negative for filarial and Toxoplasma antibodies while stool was negative for oocytes and amoebic cysts. Further, his serum was negative for dengue virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B antibodies. He was clinically well on day 6 after stopping cloxacillin with 44% neutrophils and 18% eosinophils. His C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate became normal, and there was no further plan for cardiothoracic intervention or administration of antimicrobials. He was discharged from hospital and remained well 6\u2009months later.CONCLUSION: This case report signifies the potential fatal adverse effect of cloxacillin in methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infections. Leukopenia is associated with prolonged use of high doses of cloxacillin. In addition to transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and inflammatory markers, sequential white blood cells and differential counts would help clinicians to assess the prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis.", "label": 0}

Surgical endometrial ablation was recommended to the patient based on the following findings. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy showed non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia.", "knowledge": "INTRODUCTION: The most frequent symptom suggesting endometrial pathology is uterine bleeding. Each postmenopausal uterine bleeding requires fraction explorative curettage and histopathologic examination of the material obtained from the cervical canal and uterine cavity. The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of ultrasonography as a non-invasive method in detection of endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women, and to find out whether its more frequent use could safely decrease the number of curettages in detection of these conditions.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective investigation has been performed in postmenopausal women not menstruating for more than a year, and who reported to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Novi Sad for uterine bleeding during 1996 and 1997. Each woman underwent ultrasonographic examination by vaginal probe of 5 MHz and fraction curettage, whereas the samples from cervical canal (if obtained) and from uterine cavity were sent to histopathologic examination to the Institute of Pathology in Novi Sad. Standard statistical methods have been used for the analysis of the results. Validity of the applied ultrasonographic method in detecting endometrial pathology has been estimated by calculation of its sensitivity and specificity.RESULTS: A satisfactory visualisation of the endometrium has been obtained in all 35 examined cases. The thinnest endometrium was 1 mm wide and the thickest one was--25 mm. The fraction curettage has been used to obtain material from the cervix in 2 cases and from the uterine cavity in 35 cases. In our patients with uterine bleeding, who were in the postmenopause for 13 years on average, endometrial atrophy was recorded in 17.14%, endometrial polyp in 11.43%, endometrial hyperplasia in 22.86%, endometrial adenocarcinoma in 42.86% and uterine sarcoma in 5.71%. There were 2 false negative ultrasonographic findings (2 cases of endometrial hyperplasia) and sonographic thickness less than standard versus 2 false positive cases (endometrium thicker than the limit value, 7 and 14 mm, with no real pathology) which showed that the sensitivity of the investigated method was 93.10% and the specificity was 66.66%, if the limit value for the thickness of endometrium was 3 mm.DISCUSSION: Ultrasonographic thickness of endometrium means maximum double thickness in longitudinal plane, i.e. the distance of the opposite bordering surfaces of endometrium and myometrium. The procedure of measurements of endometrial thickness is simple in most cases. Most authors agree that there is a positive correlation between the thickness of endometrium and its pathological conditions. The most often used limit values are 3 and 4 mm. Higher limit values of endometrial thickness increase the sensitivity of the method even to 100%, but negatively affect its specificity making this method inadequate as a screening method for endometrial carcinoma. Many authors insist on introducing other criteria for evaluation of the endometrium i.e. for taking its thickness as the only criterion. Ultrasonography does not provide a completely safe differentiation between benign hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.CONCLUSION: The transvaginal sonography is an efficient and acceptable, noninvasive method for early detection of endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women. The thickened endometrium during menopause is the most significant ultrasonographic criterion implicating its pathology. The vaginosonographically measured thickness of 3 mm and less, gives a relatively safe prediction of endometrial atrophy, whereas the thickness above 3 mm requires explorative curettage and histopathologic examination of the endometrium, no matter if the woman has or has not uterine bleeding.

She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation.

Progestin therapy was prescribed to the patient. ", "knowledge": "A 41-year-old white female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and alopecia universalis presented on January 24, 2002 with a recently changing mole. She indicated changes in size and color of the superior aspect of a mole that had been present for more than 8 years. She had approximately 20 lifetime peeling sunburns due to being a lifeguard. No family or previous personal history of skin cancers, including melanoma or atypical nevi, was reported. Her history of alopecia universalis began 12 years previously and has partially resolved with remaining patchy alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. On diagnosis of alopecia universalis, she was initially treated with oral prednisone for 1 year and topical minoxidil for 3 months. Currently, she is not being treated for this condition. She denied other previous skin conditions. She had a surgical history of tonsillectomy at the age of 7 years. Her current medication includes levothyroxine (0.015 microg) for hypothyroidism diagnosed 12 years previously. She reported no known drug allergies. During the initial physical examination, she presented with phototype II skin with two adjacent pigmented lesions on her left foot within a 1.3 cm square. The first lesion on the left posterior distal heel was an irregular, brown-black, 0.5 x 0.6 cm macule. The second lesion, on the left posterior proximal heel, was an irregular, brown, speckled, 0.3 x 0.4 cm macule (Fig. 1). The patient had ophiasis of the scalp and total alopecia of the bilateral eyebrows. In keeping with the patient's wishes, alopecia lesions were not biopsied and clinical photographs of the alopecia are not included in this article. Two 3 mm punch biopsies were performed within each lesion. The left posterior proximal lesion showed malignant melanoma, with a Breslow depth of 0.4 mm, anatomic level II, marked lymphocytic response and partial regression (Fig. 2). The left posterior distal lesion showed malignant melanoma in situ, arising in a lentiginous compound nevus, with architectural disorder and cytological atypia. These two lesions were concluded to be one lesion with clinical regression. She underwent local excision with 1-cm margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy owing to the presence of regression, which showed no evidence of metastatic melanoma. Lactate dehydrogenase and chest X-ray were within normal limits. The alopecia areas were not biopsied previously or at that time.", "label": 1}

The objective of this report was to present a case of amniotic fluid embolism in a primipara undergoing analgesia for vaginal delivery. CASE REPORT This is a 38-year old pregnant woman with amniotic sac ruptured, cervix with 5-cm dilation, complaining of severe pain; the patient was agitated, diaphoretic, and with tachysystoly. After venipuncture, Ringer's lactate with 5 IU of oxytocin was infused slowly, blood pressure (BP) 110 x 70 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 115 bpm with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 98%. It was decided to use a combined technique: 2.5 mg of heavy bupivacaine and 20 microg of fentanyl were administered in the subarachnoid space and a catheter was inserted into the epidural space. Twenty minutes after the institution of analgesia, the patient complained of sudden onset of severe pruritus, she was agitated, with nausea and vomiting, pale, HR 160 bpm, tachypneic, SpO2 80%, and BP could not be detected. Normal saline (500 mL) associated with hydrocortisone, ephedrine (50 mg), and oxygen with a face mask at 10 L.min(-1) were administered. At that moment, she presented BP 60 x 30 mmHg, HR 150 bpm, and SpO2 92%. Since BP tended to decrease, a total of 7 mg of metaraminol were administered divided in several doses. After vaginal delivety the patient was transferred to the ICU with BP90 x 60 mmHg, HR 110, and tachypnea. Two hours later, she developed bleeding and hypotension; disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was diagnosed and the patient treated with crystalloid solutions, packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. She was discharged from the ICU in the 3rd postoperative day (PO).CONCLUSIONS: Due to the dramatic presentation, severity, and fast installation of the symptoms, the speed and objectivity of the measures instituted to maintain vital signs are fundamental and decisive for survival of pregnant patients.

His medical history was significant for a gunshot wound to the head 3 years prior, with a residual seizure disorder. He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 50/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days).

He was apparently well, except for left Bell's palsy which developed on May 9 of 1994, for which he received stellate ganglion block on the left side more than ten times until July 2nd of 1994, when he noted pain in his left shoulder and in his lumbar region. On July 5th, he noted some difficulty in urination. On July 6th, he noted tingling sensation in his four extremities and difficulty in gait. He was admitted to another hospital where he was treated with intravenous infusion of glycerol. After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar. He was transferred to our hospital on July 14th. His past medical history revealed that he had suffered from frequent bouts of osteomyelitis since the age of 13 years. He was operated on several times on osteomyelitis. He had been treated on his tooth ache until shortly before the onset of the present illness. He also received steroid hormone for his Bell's palsy. On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 34 cells/microliter (approximately two thirds were neutrophils), RBC 1,110/microliter, 2,949 mg/dl of protein, and 119 mg/dl of glucose; stapylococcus aureus was cultured from the CSF. Myelogram showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space between the low thoracic and the upper lumbar region. The patient was treated with cephotaxim, aminobenzyl penicillin, and chloramphenicol. On the second hospital day, his BT was still 39 degrees C and he was agitated His weakness was worse than the previous day. Spinal MRI was attempted; as he was agitated 5 mg of diazepam was given intravenously at 4 PM. His respiration was rapid and somewhat shallow. At 6 PM, gadolinium DTPA was injected intravenously; at that time, he was breathing and pupils were 3 mm on both sides. At 6:35 PM, an examiner noted that he stopped breathing; the left pupil was dilated to 5 mm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately, and intubation was performed. He was placed on a respirator. His blood pressure did not reach 100 mmHg; he was in deep coma. Cardiac arrest occurred at 8:53 AM on the next morning. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC.

Majority thought that the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant with low penetrance. alpha-Synuclein mutation causes an autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease, but this type is very rare in non-Greek populations and the penetrance is high. Chromosome 2-linked autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease shows low penetrance. There are many other autosomal dominant forms of familial Parkinson's disease linked to yet unknown chromosome loci. Majority thought that this patient also had a form of Lewy-body positive autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease of unknown chromosome locus. Post mortem examination revealed ischemic intestinal lesion with strangulation. This was thought to be the cause of her death. In the central nervous system, the brain appeared to be normal by inspection. In the coronal sections, the substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus showed marked depigmentation. Histologic examination revealed marked neuronal loss and Lewy body formation in the remaining neurons. Pathologic examination was consistent with Parkinson's disease.

Results of a throat swab were positive for influenza A infection (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assay), and the patient was treated with oseltamivir. The patient's constitutional symptoms improved slightly, but within 2 days after her initial presentation, she returned to her primary care provider and described 24 hours of dysuria and vulvar swelling.

Physical examination showed ulceration and swelling of the labia minora, and the patient received an empiric dose of acyclovir (200 mg 4 times daily) for presumed autoinoculated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. An ulcer swab was performed, and urinalysis revealed no evidence of infection. Two days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with increasing vulvar pain and vaginal discharge. The previous ulcer swab findings were negative for HSV (PCR assay), and consequently, acyclovir was discontinued after 1 day of therapy. She received topical viscous lidocaine and an empiric dose of oral fluconazole. The lidocaine provided temporary symptomatic relief. Results of DNA amplification studies were negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A potassium hydroxide preparation was negative for fungi, and an ulcer swab for bacterial culture revealed usual flora. Of note, the PCR assay for Epstein-Barr virus was not performed on ulcer cells. The patient was referred to the department of dermatology, and results of a physical examination showed copious white mucoid discharge and a 2-cm ulceration of the left labia minora (Figure, panel A). Two smaller pinpoint ulcerations and swelling of the left labia minora were also noted. The lesions were clinically indistinguishable from the genital aphthous ulcers of patients with complex aphthosis (recurrent, severe aphthous ulcers on oral or genital mucosa). A diagnosis of ulcus vulvae acutum was made, and treatment was started with clobetasol 0.05% ointment (4 times daily) and lidocaine gel as needed. Four days later, the patient reported marked symptomatic improvement. Physical examination showed near resolution of the large vulvar ulceration (Figure, panel B). The patient tapered use of clobetasol ointment over the next several days until the ulcerations healed completely. Two months after her initial episode, the patient again had 3 small vulvar erosions after symptoms that included low-grade fever, malaise, and vomiting.

The most common symptom was blood-stained vaginal discharge/vaginal bleeding (49%). Duration of symptoms varied from 1 day to 2 years. Fifty-four percent of the patients recalled insertion of the foreign object, usually by the girl herself. All but three patients (91%) either recalled insertion of the foreign object and/or had vaginal bleeding or blood-stained or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, and/or visualization or palpation of the foreign body in physical examination. Symptoms resolved after removal of the foreign body followed by a single irrigation with Providon-Iod (Betadine).CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients a carefully obtained history and physical examination suggest the diagnosis of a vaginal foreign object. The leading symptoms are vaginal bleeding and blood-stained or foul smelling vaginal discharge. Removal of the foreign object followed by a single irrigation with Providon-Iod is the definitive treatment and does not require additional measures.", "label": 1}

The infant was delivered by cesarean section after amniotic membranes had been ruptured for less than 12 hours due to signs of fetal distress. The Apgar score was 3 and 3 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The infant was intubated and resuscitated, and transferred immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit. She had an extremely protuberant and cyanotic abdomen. Dilated cutaneous collateral vessels were apparent in the periumbilical region. Abdominal sonography showed cystic multiloculated tumorous mass filled with dense, flocculent content at the level of hepatic portal. The tumorous mass occupied the majority of the abdomen with caudal extension toward the pelvis and dorsally toward the spine. The liver was displaced high under the diaphragm with the left liver lobe in the left hemiabdomen. On x-ray the lung were collapsed due to a large abdominal mass in the right hemiabdomen that displaced the right diaphragm and intestines contralaterally. She soon developed bilateral pneumothoraces. Drainage and continuous suction were started. The infant failed to improve despite all attempts and died. On autopsy, an extremely large, mobile, multichambered, solitary cyst was found. It was attached to the mesenteric side of the ileum by its own thin peduncular stalk and had no communication with the remainder of the gut. It occupied the majority of the abdomen. Histologic section revealed a well-developed smooth muscle wall and inner mucosa of small bowel type. Respiratory distress is a common problem in premature infants. The majority of cases are due to pulmonary disorders (e. g., hyaline membrane disease, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia), hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and congenital heart disease. Anatomic problems including space occupying lesions are less common. Duplications of the alimentary tract in infants and children are rare congenital anomalies. Although symptoms can occur at any age, they usually present during the first year. In our patient, intraabdominal mass caused severe respiratory distress and respiratory failure in the first hours of postnatal life. This had been seen before only as a complication of intrathoracic lesions extending into the abdominal cavity. Pathology revealed spherical intestinal duplication that was completely separated from the alimentary tract. Embryologically, it was a localized duplication. Respiratory distress in our patient was refractory to all means of mechanical ventilation. Poor lung compliance was the consequence of prenatal lung hypoplasia and inadequate postnatal lung expansion due to the duplication cyst space occupying character and its compressive effect. Prenatal diagnosis was the child's only chance for survival but it was not made. Duplications of the alimentary tract can present a diagnostic challenge even in the first hours of life. They should be included in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory distress, especially in premature infants in which timely prenatal diagnosis cannot be always made.

The respiratory distress in this case was refractory to mechanical ventilation due to prenatal lung hypoplasia", "full_text": "A 4700-g (10.3-lb) male newborn is delivered at 37 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The newborn appears pale. Temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), pulse is 180/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Examination in the delivery room shows midfacial hypoplasia, infraorbital creases, and a large tongue. The right side of the body is larger than the left. Abdominal examination shows that the abdominal viscera protrudes through the abdominal wall at the umbilicus; the viscera are covered by the amniotic membrane and the peritoneum. The liver is palpated 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 cm below the right costal margin. Fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 60 mg/dL. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows enlarged kidneys bilaterally. Serial abdominal ultrasonography ordered.", "knowledge": "Differential diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress includes pulmonary and systemic disorders and anatomic problems compromising respiratory system. We report on a 2770-g female born to a 29-year-old gravida 3, para 2 woman after 34 weeks of gestation. Antenatal ultrasound performed in week 8 and 21 was normal. The infant was delivered by cesarean section after amniotic membranes had been ruptured for less than 12 hours due to signs of fetal distress. The Apgar score was 3 and 3 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The infant was intubated and resuscitated, and transferred immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit. She had an extremely protuberant and cyanotic abdomen. Dilated cutaneous collateral vessels were apparent in the periumbilical region. Abdominal sonography showed cystic multiloculated tumorous mass filled with dense, flocculent content at the level of hepatic portal. The tumorous mass occupied the majority of the abdomen with caudal extension toward the pelvis and dorsally toward the spine. The liver was displaced high under the diaphragm with the left liver lobe in the left hemiabdomen. On x-ray the lung were collapsed due to a large abdominal mass in the right hemiabdomen that displaced the right diaphragm and intestines contralaterally. She soon developed bilateral pneumothoraces. Drainage and continuous suction were started. The infant failed to improve despite all attempts and died. On autopsy, an extremely large, mobile, multichambered, solitary cyst was found. It was attached to the mesenteric side of the ileum by its own thin peduncular stalk and had no communication with the remainder of the gut. It occupied the majority of the abdomen. Histologic section revealed a well-developed smooth muscle wall and inner mucosa of small bowel type. Respiratory distress is a common problem in premature infants. The majority of cases are due to pulmonary disorders (e. g., hyaline membrane disease, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia), hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and congenital heart disease. Anatomic problems including space occupying lesions are less common. Duplications of the alimentary tract in infants and children are rare congenital anomalies. Although symptoms can occur at any age, they usually present during the first year. In our patient, intraabdominal mass caused severe respiratory distress and respiratory failure in the first hours of postnatal life. This had been seen before only as a complication of intrathoracic lesions extending into the abdominal cavity. Pathology revealed spherical intestinal duplication that was completely separated from the alimentary tract. Embryologically, it was a localized duplication. Respiratory distress in our patient was refractory to all means of mechanical ventilation. Poor lung compliance was the consequence of prenatal lung hypoplasia and inadequate postnatal lung expansion due to the duplication cyst space occupying character and its compressive effect. Prenatal diagnosis was the child's only chance for survival but it was not made. Duplications of the alimentary tract can present a diagnostic challenge even in the first hours of life. They should be included in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory distress, especially in premature infants in which timely prenatal diagnosis cannot be always made. We propose their inclusion among other space occupying lesions that might be the cause of severe respiratory distress even in the earliest neonatal period.", "label": 1}

The general exam was unremarkable except for some tenderness on deep palpation of the right groin area. An abdominal examination was unsatisfactory because of obesity. The physician suggested the possibility of a right inguinal hernia, but was reluctant to commit to this diagnosis because of the poor abdominal exam. He charted \"Impression: possible right inguinal hernia.TREATMENT: 1) lose weight, 2) Donnatal AC & HS.\" Eight weeks after the initial visit, the patient returned with the same complaints. Both the exam and vitals were unchanged from the previous visit. Six months later the patient's weight and abdominal exam remained the same, but his pain was worse. He reported that he had bright red blood in his stool twice. A rectal exam was essentially normal, though a fecal test was guaiacpositive. The patient was immediately referred to a local surgeon for consultation. After routine colon prep, the surgeon performed a flexible sigmoidoscopy. He found a lesion. The pathology report noted an adenocarcinoma of the colon. A left colectomy revealed some serosal involvement and several positive mesenteric nodes. Three months after the surgery, the patient sued the original family physician, alleging delay of diagnosis.

Initially, her pain was managed with oral morphine 2 mg (approx. 0.2 mg/kg) every 4 hours. Because she was quite somnolent but still in significant pain, analgesia was then changed to methadone 1 mg orally every 6 hours (approximately 0.1 mg/kg/dose) and was eventually increased over 36 hours to 2 mg every 6 hours (approximately 0.2 mg/kg/dose). She received oral methadone 0.6 mg (approximately 0.05 mg/kg) every 4 hours as needed for breakthrough pain. She continued to have severe pain and experienced side effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, visual hallucinations, and vomiting. An intravenous ketamine infusion was started at 100 microg/kg/hour. Regular opioid administration was ceased, but she was given intravenous morphine 0.5 to 0.75 mg for breakthrough pain. She required only zero to three doses of breakthrough morphine per day, initially. After starting the ketamine infusion, her pain control improved and her symptoms of opioid toxicity abated. She was more alert and able to partake in limited activities. As a result of pain from progressive disease, the ketamine infusion was increased to 200 microg/kg/hour after 6 days with positive results. Her condition continued to deteriorate. An intravenous morphine infusion was initiated 2 weeks after starting the ketamine infusion and was eventually increased to 50 microg/kg/hour. One week later, she died with reasonable pain control.

Patients were identified retrospectively, searching for patients diagnosed with IRF, after retroperitoneal biopsy or, in most cases the diagnosis rested on radiological findings, especially CT, with identification of a retroperitoneal mass, the absence of other demonstrable renal or ureteric disease or any other pathology that could explain the findings. CT was very useful in describing the retroperitoneal mass around the aorta and inferior vena cava, the extent of the lesion and for monitoring the response to surgical treatment during the follow-up. The data were evaluated about medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory tests (serum urea and creatinine, blood sugar, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate levels, serum pH, uric acid, haematocrit, white blood cell count), imaging methods (renal ultrasound, abdominal CT-scan, MRI). At admission all patients had active disease with obstructive renal failure and underwent bilateral ureteric stenting in order to normalize the BUN levels. After normalizing of BUN levels, ureterolysis and omental wrapping was performed. Postoperatively, ureteric stents were removed after 1 month and remission of renal disfunction was obtained in approximately 5 months (range 2-10 months). All patients were followed for at least 1 year. Patients were regularly checked every 3 months.RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, there were 5 men and 14 women. The median age at diagnosis of RF was 50 years (range 42-64 years). The most frequent presenting symptoms were back or abdominal pain, weakness, weight loss, oligoanuria, arterial hypertension and mild fever. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 6 to 18 months. At presentation all patients had active disease, presenting renal dysfunction with a median serum creatinine of 5.18 mg/dl (range 1-15.4 mg/dl). Most of the patients had moderate bilateral hydronephrosis (2nd degree hydronephrosis). In our study, all patients had excellent prognosis, with full recovery of renal function in 78% of cases (15 patients). The fractal dimension of the fibrosis mass contour correlates with level of renal function impairment. Even more, the fractal dimension seems to slightly variate between CT evaluations (1.30 +/- 0.1), suggesting a non aggressive pattern of extension of the fibrotic mass characteristic for benign lesions.CONCLUSIONS: The imaging parameters did not predict the disease severity, except the increase in fractal dimension of fibrosis surface area. Efficacy of bilateral ureteric stenting in improving renal function is limited in most of the cases. Dispite the level of renal function impairment at admission, full recovery can be achieved after bilateral ureteric stenting/nephrostomy and ureterolisis.", "label": 0}

We included patients with PaO2 >80 mm Hg, at positive end-expiratory pressure of <15 cm H2O and with F(IO2) up to 1.0.INTERVENTIONS: After enrollment, PSV was instituted and patients were strictly monitored during the following 48 hrs. Subjects who met any of the predefined PSV failure criteria during this period were returned to CPPV (Group F). PSV was continued in the remaining patients (Group S).MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and hemodynamics measurements were collected before switching from CPPV to PSV and were repeated at 24 hrs after beginning PSV, or immediately before return to CPPV in Group F patients. The physiologic deadspace volume to tidal volume ratio (V(D)/V(T)) was obtained by the Enghoff's equation from the measurement of the mixed expired CO2 fraction. PSV resulted in a significant PaCO2 decrease (49.2+/-10.9 mm Hg to 44.4+/-7.2 mm Hg) and significant increases in minute volume (V(E))(9.0+/-2.3 L/min to 12.0+/-4.0 L/min) and arterial blood pH (7.405+/-0.054 to 7.435+/-0.064), with stable oxygenation and hemodynamics. In patients who were hypercapnic (PaCO2 >50 mm Hg) during CPPV, the V(E) increase was higher than in normocapnic patients. In the latter patients, PaCO2 and pH did not change significantly going from CPPV to PSV. A total of 38 patients (79%) were allocated to Group S and the remaining 10 patients were included in Group F. In Group S, positive endexpiratory pressure of 9.4+/-2.9 cm H2O (range, 3-14 cm H2O) and a PSV level of 14.9+/-3.8 cm H2O (range, 9-22 cm H2O) were applied. In Group F, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8.9+/-3.1 cm H2O (range, 5-15 cm H2O) and a PSV level of 21.6+/-4.6 cm H2O (range, 16-31 cm H2O) were adopted. Compared with Group S, Group F had a longer duration of intubation (20.2+/-19.2 days vs. 9.2+/-13.5 days), a lower static compliance of the respiratory system (30.4+/-16.5 mL/cm H2O vs. 41.7+/-15.0 mL/cm H2O), and a higher V(D)/V(T) (0.70+/-0.09 vs. 0.52+/-0.10), but similar oxygenation and positive end-expiratory pressure. V(E) was higher in Group F during both CPPV and PSV.CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively high proportion of the investigated patients, PSV was successful. The institution of PSV led to no major changes in oxygenation or in hemodynamics. PSV was associated with increases in V(E) and respiratory frequency. In patients who had been hypercapnic during CPPV, PaCO2 decreased despite a compensated pH.

We included patients with PaO2 >80 mm Hg, at positive end-expiratory pressure of <15 cm H2O and with F(IO2) up to 1.0.INTERVENTIONS: After enrollment, PSV was instituted and patients were strictly monitored during the following 48 hrs. Subjects who met any of the predefined PSV failure criteria during this period were returned to CPPV (Group F). PSV was continued in the remaining patients (Group S).MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, and hemodynamics measurements were collected before switching from CPPV to PSV and were repeated at 24 hrs after beginning PSV, or immediately before return to CPPV in Group F patients. The physiologic deadspace volume to tidal volume ratio (V(D)/V(T)) was obtained by the Enghoff's equation from the measurement of the mixed expired CO2 fraction. PSV resulted in a significant PaCO2 decrease (49.2+/-10.9 mm Hg to 44.4+/-7.2 mm Hg) and significant increases in minute volume (V(E))(9.0+/-2.3 L/min to 12.0+/-4.0 L/min) and arterial blood pH (7.405+/-0.054 to 7.435+/-0.064), with stable oxygenation and hemodynamics. In patients who were hypercapnic (PaCO2 >50 mm Hg) during CPPV, the V(E) increase was higher than in normocapnic patients. In the latter patients, PaCO2 and pH did not change significantly going from CPPV to PSV. A total of 38 patients (79%) were allocated to Group S and the remaining 10 patients were included in Group F. In Group S, positive endexpiratory pressure of 9.4+/-2.9 cm H2O (range, 3-14 cm H2O) and a PSV level of 14.9+/-3.8 cm H2O (range, 9-22 cm H2O) were applied. In Group F, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8.9+/-3.1 cm H2O (range, 5-15 cm H2O) and a PSV level of 21.6+/-4.6 cm H2O (range, 16-31 cm H2O) were adopted. Compared with Group S, Group F had a longer duration of intubation (20.2+/-19.2 days vs. 9.2+/-13.5 days), a lower static compliance of the respiratory system (30.4+/-16.5 mL/cm H2O vs. 41.7+/-15.0 mL/cm H2O), and a higher V(D)/V(T) (0.70+/-0.09 vs. 0.52+/-0.10), but similar oxygenation and positive end-expiratory pressure. V(E) was higher in Group F during both CPPV and PSV.CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively high proportion of the investigated patients, PSV was successful. The institution of PSV led to no major changes in oxygenation or in hemodynamics. PSV was associated with increases in V(E) and respiratory frequency. In patients who had been hypercapnic during CPPV, PaCO2 decreased despite a compensated pH. Compared with PSV success patients, patients who failed PSV appeared to be sicker, as shown by the higher duration of respiratory support, increased ventilatory needs, and decreased respiratory system compliance, despite similar arterial oxygenation and positive end-expiratory pressure.", "label": 1}

On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl. Cerebrospinal fluid contained 34 cells/microliter (approximately two thirds were neutrophils), RBC 1,110/microliter, 2,949 mg/dl of protein, and 119 mg/dl of glucose; stapylococcus aureus was cultured from the CSF. Myelogram showed a filling defect in the anterior epidural space between the low thoracic and the upper lumbar region.

The mode of delivery was a significant factor affecting SpO(2); infants delivered by cesarean section had a significantly lower SpO(2) and took a longer time to reach SpO(2) >or=85% compared with those delivered by vaginal delivery (HR=1.96, 95% CI=1.11 to 3.49; P=0.02). All enrolled newborns had no serious complications and they survived to discharge.CONCLUSION: SpO(2) in preterm newborns gradually increased with time. Approximately half of the preterm newborns had an SpO(2) <90% during the first 5 min of life. Infants delivered by cesarean section had a lower SpO(2) than those delivered by vaginal delivery.", "label": 0}

Her BP started to drop on September 2 and she developed cardiac arrest on the same day. She was discussed in a neurological CPC. The chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had a form of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease. As parents did not have Parkinson's disease, some of the participants raised the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance. But the age of onset was too late for autosomal recessive inheritance. Majority thought that the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant with low penetrance. alpha-Synuclein mutation causes an autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease, but this type is very rare in non-Greek populations and the penetrance is high. Chromosome 2-linked autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease shows low penetrance. There are many other autosomal dominant forms of familial Parkinson's disease linked to yet unknown chromosome loci. Majority thought that this patient also had a form of Lewy-body positive autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease of unknown chromosome locus. Post mortem examination revealed ischemic intestinal lesion with strangulation. This was thought to be the cause of her death. In the central nervous system, the brain appeared to be normal by inspection. In the coronal sections, the substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus showed marked depigmentation.

Her BP started to drop on September 2 and she developed cardiac arrest on the same day. She was discussed in a neurological CPC. The chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had a form of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease. As parents did not have Parkinson's disease, some of the participants raised the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance. But the age of onset was too late for autosomal recessive inheritance. Majority thought that the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant with low penetrance. alpha-Synuclein mutation causes an autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease, but this type is very rare in non-Greek populations and the penetrance is high. Chromosome 2-linked autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease shows low penetrance. There are many other autosomal dominant forms of familial Parkinson's disease linked to yet unknown chromosome loci. Majority thought that this patient also had a form of Lewy-body positive autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease of unknown chromosome locus. Post mortem examination revealed ischemic intestinal lesion with strangulation. This was thought to be the cause of her death. In the central nervous system, the brain appeared to be normal by inspection. In the coronal sections, the substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus showed marked depigmentation. Histologic examination revealed marked neuronal loss and Lewy body formation in the remaining neurons. Pathologic examination was consistent with Parkinson's disease.

A 6-year-old, 30-kg boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ingested 15-20 olanzapine (5 mg) tablets. He was agitated and was treated with lorazepam at a local hospital. His heart rate was 148 beats per min; respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; blood pressure, 111/70 mmHg; temperature, 96.8F, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air.

The agitation worsened and did not respond to benzodiazepines. The patient was then given a dose of 0.6 mg physostigmine (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously with reversal of the agitation. But the effect only lasted 45 min requiring administration of a second bolus of 0.6 mg (0.02 mg/kg). A physostigmine intravenous infusion was administered at a rate of 0.5 mg/h (0.0167 mg/kg/h). Overnight, the patient became more agitated. The physostigmine was discontinued, and IV dexmedetomidine (0.2 g/kg/h) was started at 21:00. The patient became over-sedated with pinpoint pupils resulting in discontinuation of the dexmedetomidine at 04:00. The patient again became agitated and developed visual hallucinations.

Initial vital signs were blood pressure 175/118 mmHg, heart rate 98/min, respirations 12/min, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Physical exam revealed few scattered rhonchi, without signs of distress. Initial arterial blood gases (ABG's) revealed pH 7.42, pCO2 43 mmHg, pO2 68 mmHg, HCO3 27 meq/L, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Initial chest x-ray 2 hours after the exposure demonstrated clear lung fields. Approximately 2.5 hours after the exposure, he began complaining of dyspnea, restlessness and his oxygen saturation dropped below 90%.

The disorder is included under anxiety disorders because it shares some obsessive-compulsive features. Patients have the tendency towards feelings of unattractiveness, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (1,2). It is a major psychiatric problem, but many patients with this disorder first present to a dermatologist. An 11-year-old girl came to our department with a 2-month history of diffuse hair loss on the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area (Figure 1). She had originally been examined by a pediatrician with the diagnosis of alopecia areata. The patient`s personal history included hay fever and shortsightedness, and she suffered from varicella and mononucleosis. Nobody in the family history suffered from alopecia areata, but her father has male androgenetic alopecia (Norwood/Hamilton MAGA C3F3). The mother noticed that the child had had changeable mood for about 2 months and did not want to communicate with other persons in the family. The family did not have any pet at home. At school, her favorite subjects were Math and Computer Studies. She did not like Physical Education and did not participate in any sport activities during her free time. This was very strange because she was obese (body-mass index (BMI) 24.69). She was sometimes angry with her 13-year-old sister who had better results at school. The girl had suddenly started to wear a blue scarf. The parents did not notice that she pulled out her hair at home. Dermatological examination of the capillitium found a zone of incomplete alopecia in the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area, without inflammation, desquamation, and scaring. Hairs were of variable length (Figure 1). There was a patch of incomplete alopecia above the forehead between two stripes of hair of variable length (Figure 2). The hair pull test was negative along the edges of the alopecia. Mycological examination from the skin capillitium was negative. The trichoscopy and skin biopsy of the parietotemporal region of the capillitium (Figure 3) confirmed trichotillomania. Laboratory tests (blood count, iron, ferritin, transferrin, selenium, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, serology and hormones of thyroid gland) were negative. We referred the girl for ophthalmologic and psychological examination. Ophthalmologic examination proved that there was no need to add any more diopters. The psychological examination provided us with a picture in which she drew her family (Figure 4). The strongest authority in the family was the mother because she looked after the girls for most of the day. She was in the first place in the picture. The father had longer working hours and spent more time outside the home. He worked as a long vehicle driver. He was in the second place in the picture. There was sibling rivalry between the girls, but the parents did not notice this problem and preferred the older daughter. She was successful at school and was prettier (slim, higher, curly brown hair, without spectacles). Our 11-years-old patient noticed all these differences between them, but at her level of mental development was not able to cope with this problem. She wanted to be her sister's equal. The sister is drawn in the picture in the third place next to father, while the patient's own figure was drawn larger and slim even though she was obese. Notably, all three female figures had very nice long brown hair. It seemed that the mother and our patient had better quality of hair and more intense color than the sister in the drawing. The only hairless person in the picture was the father. The girl did not want to talk about her problems and feelings at home. Then it was confirmed that our patient was very sensitive, anxious, willful, and withdrawn. She was interested in her body and very perceptive of her physical appearance. From the psychological point of view, the parents started to pay more interest to their younger daughter and tried to understand and help her. After consultation with the psychiatrist, we did not start psychopharmacologic therapy for trichotillomania; instead, we started treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, mild shampoo, mild topical steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%) in solution and methionine in capsules. With parents' cooperation, the treatment was successful. The name trichotillomania was first employed by the French dermatologist Francois Henri Hallopeau in 1889, who described a young man pulling his hair out in tufts (3-5). The word is derived from the Greek thrix (hair), tillein (to pull), and mania (madness) (5). The prevalence of TTM in the general adult population ranges from 0.6% to 4%, and 2-4% of the general psychiatric outpatient population meet the criteria for TTM (2-5). The prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at less than 1% (5). The disease can occur at any age and in any sex. The age of onset of hair pulling is significantly later for men than for women (3). There are three subsets of age: preschool children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. The mean age of onset is pre-pubertal. It ranges from 8 to 13 years (on average 11.3 years) (2-5). The occurrence of hair-pulling in the first year of life is a rare event, probably comprising <1% of cases (5). The etiology of TTM is complex and may be triggered by a psychosocial stressor within the family, such as separation from an attachment figure, hospitalization of the child or parent, birth of a younger sibling, sibling rivalry, moving to a new house, or problems with school performance. It has been hypothesized that the habit may begin with \"playing\" with the hair, with later chronic pulling resulting in obvious hair loss (2). Environment is a factor because children usually pull their hair when alone and in relaxed surroundings. The bedroom, bathroom, or family room are \"high-risk\" situations for hair-pulling (5). Men and women also differed in terms of the hair pulling site (men pull hair from the stomach/back and the moustache/beard areas, while women pull from the scalp) (3). Pulling hair from siblings, pets, dolls, and stuffed animals has also been documented, often occurring in the same pattern as in the patient (5). Genetic factors contributing to the development of TTM are mutations of the SLITRK1 gene, which plays a role in cortex development and neuronal growth. The protein SAPAP3 has been present in 4.2% of TTM cases and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be involved in the development of the spectrum of OCD. A significantly different concordance rate for TTM was found in monozygotic (38.1%) compared with dizygotic (0%) twins in 34 pairs (3). The core diagnostic feature is the repetitive pulling of hairs from one`s own body, resulting in hair loss. The targeted hair is mostly on the scalp (75%), but may also be from the eyebrows (42%), eyelashes (53%), beard (10%), and pubic area (17%) (3,5). There are three subtypes of hair pulling - early onset, automatic, and focused. Diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV criteria are (2,3,5): 1) recurrent pulling of one`s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss; 2) an increasing sense of tension immediately prior to pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior; 3) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair; 4) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g., a dermatologic condition); 5) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The differential diagnosis includes alopecia areata (Table 1) (6), tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, secondary syphilis, traction alopecia, loose anagen syndrome, lichen planopilaris, alopecia mucinosa, and scleroderma (2-5). Biopsy of an involved area (ideally from a recent site of hair loss) can help to confirm the diagnosis (5). On histologic examination, there are typically increased numbers of catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation. Chronic hair pulling induces a catagen phase, and more hairs will be telogen hairs. Pigment casts and empty anagen follicles are often seen. Perifollicular hemorrhage near the hair bulb is an indicator of TTM (2). Complications of TTM are rare, but they comprise secondary bacterial infections with regional lymphadenopathy as a result of picking and scratching at the scalp. Many patients play with and ingest the pulled hairs (e.g. touching the hair to lips, biting, and chewing). Trichophagia (ingestion of the hair) can lead to a rare complication named trichobezoar (a \"hair ball\" in stomach). This habit is present in approximately 5% to 30% of adult patients, but it is less frequent in children. Patient with trichophagia present with pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Radiologic examination and gastroscopy should not be delayed (2,4,5). The management of the disease is difficult and requires strong cooperation between the physician, patient, and parents. The dermatologist cannot take part in the therapy, strictly speaking, but without the psychological, psychopharmacologic, and topic dermatologic treatment a vicious circle will be perpetuated.

Neoral is a potent immunosuppressive agent that is highly bound in the plasma. It has been proposed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) delivers cyclosporin (CsA) to T-lymphocytes via the LDL receptor pathway, where it produces its therapeutic effects. Herein, we report a case of minimal change nephrotic syndrome with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by Neoral and fluvastatin. A 65-year-old male with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus suddenly developed nephrotic syndrome. The potential causative drugs, such as NSAIDs and antibiotics, had not been administered. The laboratory findings were as follows: proteinuria 23 g/day, serum albumin 1.9 g/dl, total cholesterol 629 mg/dl, LDL-Cho 1,930 mg/dl. Renal biopsy was normal on light microscopy, and immunofluorescence demonstrated no staining. Due to the risk of deterioration of diabetes by administering prednisolone, he was given Neoral at 2.0 mg/kg/day. He was also given fluvastatin (40 mg/day) for hyperlipidemia after the renal biopsy. At four weeks after the start of Neoral and fluvastatin, his nephrosis continued, but his LDL-Cho and total cholesterol decreased. At six weeks after treatment, proteinuria gradually reduced. At eight weeks after treatment, the proteinuria had disappeared. Nephrotic syndrome is often associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, and many patients with nephrotic syndrome show high levels of LDL-Cho. It has been reported recently that LDL apheresis is effective against nephrotic syndrome. However, in the present case, it can be speculated that the improvement of hyperlipidemia by fluvastatin probably augmented the effect of Neoral, presumably through the increased cellular uptake of Neoral. This suggests that fluvastatin may be considered as the treatment of choice for the disturbed lipoprotein profile in patients with nephrotic syndrome.", "label": 0}

Additionally, the number of patients who should be diagnosed with mixed hyperlipidemia instead of hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia was estimated.METHODS: A total of 600 high-volume prescribers of lipid-modifying drugs were identified in 6 metropolitan areas using the IMS Health prescription database. A total of 101 physician prescribers (about 17%) agreed to participate in the study and had the necessary medical records available. The participating prescribers were asked to identify all patients aged between 18 and 79 years who were seen in their practice in the last 2 years having a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 272.4) and/or hypercholesterolemia (ICD-9-CM code 272.0). ICD-9-CM code 272.2 (mixed hyperlipidemia) was purposely excluded from the criteria for patient chart selection in order to estimate the prevalence of mixed hyperlipidemia in patients previously diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and/or hypercholesterolemia. A random number generator was used to select 25 patient medical records from each office. A common instrument was used to collect data on patient demographics; clinical history; comorbid disease states; laboratory test results, including liver function; and 4 values for serum cholesterol (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG). Total cholesterol was recorded to permit calculation of non-HDL-C. Data collection via patient chart abstraction occurred from March 2004 through August 2004, performed by a staff member in each physician practice who had been trained for this purpose. Drug prescribing was identified from the patient chart.RESULTS: For the physician practice assessment portion of the project, we used patient charts if there was a complete (total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) lipid profile for baseline and follow-up, and a minimum of 6 weeks between baseline and follow-up values. At follow-up, the proportion of patients meeting goal lipid values according to the guidelines for LDL-C was 68%, 63% for HDL-C, 59% for TG, and 68% for non-HDL-C. Only 32% of patients met all 3 goals (LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG). The average time between the baseline and follow-up lipid profile was 3.7 years, with a median of 2.9 years, and a minimum of 6 weeks and a maximum of 42 years. Compared with baseline, the most recent follow-up lipid assessment for HDL-C goal attainment showed improvement by an absolute 6%, from 57% to 63% of patients. TG goal attainment improved an absolute 18% (from 41% to 59%), LDL-C goal attainment improved an absolute 45% (from 23% to 68%), non-HDL-C goal attainment improved an absolute 46% (from 22% to 68%), and the combined goals of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG improved from 8% of patients at baseline to 32% at follow-up. Of the 2,119 patients in the study population, 1,784 (84%) at the time of chart review had been prescribed at least 1 lipid-modifying medication: 1,552 (87%) a single lipid-modifying medication and 232 (13%) combination therapy. The hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme-A reductase class (statins) accounted for 89% of the monotherapy regimens. Of the patients with baseline LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG readings, 40% could have been diagnosed as having mixed hyperlipidemia, defined as having (a) baseline LDL-C greater than their NCEP ATP III goal and (b) either baseline TG of >150 mg/dL or a baseline HDL-C of <40 mg/dL for males or <50 mg/dL for females. Of the 40% of patients estimated to have mixed hyperlipidemia, 69% were prescribed lipid-modifying monotherapy, 18% were prescribed combination drug therapy, and 14% were not prescribed drug therapy.CONCLUSION: Attainment of therapeutic goals for serum lipids improved from baseline to follow-up, but approximately one third of patients did not achieve individual lipid goals and two thirds of patients did not attain goal for all 3 targets (LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG).", "label": 1}

In adults, HSV type 1 is found predominantly in the oral area, and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) is commonly found in the genital area. HSV-2 infection without genital lesions is uncommon. Herein we report a unique case of pharyngotonsillitis as an initial manifestation of disseminated HSV-2 infection without genital involvement.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and sore throat. His past medical history included hypereosinophilic syndrome diagnosed at age 45\u2009years. Physical examination revealed throat congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy in the left posterior triangle, and mild epigastric tenderness. The laboratory data demonstrated bicytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear showed hypocellular marrow with histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The diagnosis of HLH was confirmed, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy on days 1-3. On day 5, despite initial improvement of the fever and sore throat, multiple, new, small bullae developed on the patient's face, trunk, and extremities. Additional testing showed that he was positive for HSV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Disseminated HSV infection was suspected, and intravenous acyclovir (10\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h) was begun. A subsequent direct antigen test of a bulla sample was positive for HSV-2. Moreover, tonsillar and esophageal biopsies revealed viral inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed the presence of HSV-2. Disseminated HSV-2 infection with multiple bullae, tonsillitis, esophagitis, and suspected hepatic involvement was diagnosed. After a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir, his hematological status and liver function normalized, and his cutaneous skin lesions resolved.

In adults, HSV type 1 is found predominantly in the oral area, and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) is commonly found in the genital area. HSV-2 infection without genital lesions is uncommon. Herein we report a unique case of pharyngotonsillitis as an initial manifestation of disseminated HSV-2 infection without genital involvement.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of fever and sore throat. His past medical history included hypereosinophilic syndrome diagnosed at age 45\u2009years. Physical examination revealed throat congestion, bilaterally enlarged tonsils with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy in the left posterior triangle, and mild epigastric tenderness. The laboratory data demonstrated bicytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels, and hyperferritinemia. A bone marrow smear showed hypocellular marrow with histiocytes and hemophagocytosis. The diagnosis of HLH was confirmed, and the patient was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy on days 1-3. On day 5, despite initial improvement of the fever and sore throat, multiple, new, small bullae developed on the patient's face, trunk, and extremities. Additional testing showed that he was positive for HSV-specific immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G. Disseminated HSV infection was suspected, and intravenous acyclovir (10\u2009mg/kg every 8\u2009h) was begun. A subsequent direct antigen test of a bulla sample was positive for HSV-2. Moreover, tonsillar and esophageal biopsies revealed viral inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed the presence of HSV-2. Disseminated HSV-2 infection with multiple bullae, tonsillitis, esophagitis, and suspected hepatic involvement was diagnosed. After a 2-week course of intravenous acyclovir, his hematological status and liver function normalized, and his cutaneous skin lesions resolved. He was discharged on day 22 in good general health and continued taking oral valacyclovir for viral suppression due to his immunosuppressed status.CONCLUSION: Disseminated HSV-2 infection should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and impaired liver function of unknown etiology even if there are no genital lesions.", "label": 0}

The preferential localization of cyst hydatic is the liver (48%), the lung (36%) and in 6% of cases it localizes in unaccustomed place as the brain. Intracerebral localization is relatively rare, its impact is 1 to 5% of all cases of hydatidose. This localization is the child's appendage with a masculine predominance. The cyst hydatic intracranien is often lone, of localization usually supratentorielle, sometimes infratentorielle. Symptoms are especially the diffuse headache associated to various neurological signs in relation with sits of the tumor. The psychiatrics symptoms depends on its localization, sides, intracranial hypertension, and the previous personality. In 15 to 20% of cases these tumors can appear in the beginning of their evolution by the isolated psychiatric symptoms. We report the case of two patients that have been hospitalized first in the Academic Psychiatric Unit of Marrakech for isolates psychiatric disorders and whose scanning revealed the presence of cerebral hydatic cyst and that required a surgical intervention in neurosurgery. Case 1 - Patient 29 years old, bachelor, uneducated, leaving in country outside, fermar, in permanent contact with dogs. No particular medical history. The patient has been brought by his family to the psychiatric emergencies after behavior disorders. The beginning of his symptomatology was one year ago by behavior disorders: instability, violence, isolation, and a corporo-sartorial carelessness. His symptomatology worsened and the patient became very aggressive. In psychiatric unit, he was disregarded, sad, anguished, indifferent to his state, very dissonant, completely detached, depersonalized. He brought back some visual and auditory hallucinations with attitude of monitoring. He was raving with delirium of persecution, of ideas of reference and delirium of bewithment. He was unconscious of his disorders. The patient has first been put under classical neuroleptic 9 mg/day of Haloperidol and 200 mg/day of chlorpromazine. The diagnosis of schizophrenia has been kept according to criteria of DSM IV. The PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) was to 137 (score on a positive scale was to 34, score on a negative scale was to 35 and the general psychopathologie scale was to 58). One week after his hospitalization, he developed headache with subconfusion, a cerebral scanning has been made in emergency and showed a voluminous cyst in oval foramen compressing the mesencephalon strongly. The cyst was well limited, hypodense, not taking the contrast, and without intracerebral oedema, the diagnosis of cerebral hydatic cyst has been made. The complementary exploration didn't show any other localizations, and biologic exam results didn't show any particular anomalies. The patient has been operated in neurosurgery. The immediate evolution was favorable with disappearance of confusion and absence of complications. The patient was lost of view. Six months after, the patient has been readmitted to the psychiatric emergency. He dropped his neuroleptic treatment. He was aggressive, raving, hallucinated and depersonalized. The global score to the PANSS was 63. He has been put back under neuroleptics. Three weeks after improvement and passage of the PANSS to 30, the patient went out. We couldn't have a cerebral scanner of control because the patient had no medical assurance and no money for cerebral scanner. Case 2 - Patient aged of 53 years, father of four children, uneducated, native and resident of Marrakech, confectioner as profession. He is in contact with dogs since 12 years. He has been brought to the psychiatric emergencies by his family after an agitation. The history of his illness seemed to go back at eight months ago, by the progressive apparition of an instability, sleep disorders, hostility, associated with an emotional lability. To the interview he was agitated and had a delirium of persecution. He was convinced that his wife and his children plotted against him. He had sad mood. He was anguished and had auditory and visual hallucinations. The patient was not confused but it had a hypoproxie, an fixing amnesia, a disorders of judgment and a light left hemiparesia. Cerebral scanner revealed three cerebral cyst. The first measuring 42 x 40 mm, sitting at the level parietal right, to the contact of the occipital horn, dragging his/her/its amputation and an effect of mass on ventricle homolateral, the median line and ventricle controlateral. The two other, at the level of the center semi oval, behind the first, measuring 23 mm and 15 mm on the big axis. The patient has been addressed in neurosurgery. He had a completeray exploration to search other localizations. The thoracic x-ray showed 2 pulmonary cyts. The abdominal scan and imagery by magnetic resonance showed liver cyst, peri-heart cyst and mediastinal cyst. The patient has been operated for these three cysts with good recuperation on the psychiatric and neurological symptoms. He has been addressed in heart surgery for the heart localization. The hydatidose is an endemic illness in Morocco and constitute a public health problem. The cerebral localization is rare and appear by signs of cerebral hypertension and signs of focusing. The psychiatric demonstrations are rare but preserve a major interest, by the therapeutic measure specificity that they impose. Of course, the surgical ablation of the tumor can be sufficient to attenuate the psychiatric symptoms but the recourse to a specific treatment can prove to be necessary to act on the precise targets.

His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, \"I hate having to go to the nurse's office to take my albuterol!\" His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to \"poison his body with so many chemicals.\" She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is \"cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician.\" Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo's condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son's asthma. Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover. Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, \"He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!\" She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend's birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his \"weak lungs.\" She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care.", "label": 1}

After achieving remission, for further maintenance of remission, he was treated with 14 cycles of intensive chemotherapy consisting of 6-MP, 10 mg/kg orally on the first 4 days, and cyclophosphamide, 1200 mg/m2, vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2, epirubicin, 15 mg/m2, and cytosine arabinoside, 40 mg/m2, intravenously on days 4, 11, 39, and 40, respectively.

Thirty-six hours after the start of MTX infusion, leucovorin (30 mg, intravenous) rescue was initiated every 6 h for 3 days. Another preventive measure to cover MTX toxicity included aggressive intravenous fluid replacement (4 L/m2 /day) and the addition of 25 meq/L sodium bicarbonate to the intravenous fluid to alkalinize the urine. Concurrent medication included 6-MP (50 mg) once daily and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (120 mg, 600 mg) twice daily every other day.

Neurologic examination revealed that he was somnolent and he was only able to respond to simple questions such as opening eyes and grasping the examiner's hand, but he was unable to respond verbally. The optic discs were flat; the right pupil was slightly larger than the left, but both reacted to light. He showed ptosis on the left side, conjugate deviation of eyes to the left, and right facial paresis. The oculocephalic response and the corneal reflex were present.

Marked atheromatous changes were seen in the left internal carotid, the middle cerebral and the basilar arteries; the left internal carotid and the middle cerebral arteries were almost occluded by thrombi and blood coagulate. The territories of the left middle cerebral and the occipital arteries were infarcted; but the left thalamic area was spared. The neuropathologist concluded that the infarction was thrombotic origin not an embolic one as the atherosclerotic changes were severe. Cardiac rupture appeared to be the cause of terminal sudden hypotension and cardiopulmonary arrest. It appears likely that a vegetation which had been attached to the aortic valve induced thromboembolic occlusion of the left internal carotid artery which had already been markedly sclerotic by atherosclerosis.

CASE 1: A 25-year-old, gravida 3, para 1, woman was referred to our emergency clinic with the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma and massive vaginal bleeding. She had been transfused seven units of blood at the hospital where she was first admitted. Pelvic examination demonstrated heavy vaginal bleeding and a uterus equivalent to the size of 14 weeks of gestation. Her beta-hCG level was 560,000 mIU/ml. Despite four units of blood transfusion, she had a pulse rate of 130/min, arterial pressure of 90/60 mm/Hg and HCT of 19%. An emergency hysterectomy with vertical incision was performed. CASE 2: A 54-year-old, gravida 3, para 3, woman was referred to our clinic with heavy bleeding with the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. She was scanned to look for possible metastases and pulmonary metastasis was detected. Chemotherapy was planned but as sudden vaginal bleeding began she was referred to the Gynecology Department.

The results of the Pap smear demonstrate atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Pap smear will be repeated in 1 year. ", "knowledge": "BACKGROUND: The optimal management of low grade Papanicolaou (Pap) smear abnormalities remains controversial. This center's experience with recommending cytologic follow-up for women with atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) was reviewed to determine outcome and patient/physician compliance.METHODS: The records were reviewed on women with Pap smears reported as either ASCUS (320) or LSIL (112) who did not have a history of dysplasia. The cytologic and colposcopic follow-up for a 2-year period was obtained from the laboratory data base that includes the colposcopy and cancer referrals for this region. Repeat Pap smear in 6 months was recommended. If patients subsequently demonstrated high grade SIL (HSIL) or persistent ASCUS or LSIL over three time intervals, colposcopic evaluation was recommended.RESULTS: The outcome was determined by the most significant diagnosis among the follow-up Pap smears or colposcopic biopsies. 29% of patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining patients, 70.5% reverted to normal or benign cellular changes, 25.3% persisted as ASCUS or LSIL, and 5.2% progressed to HSIL. The majority of patients (68%) were referred for colposcopy for persistent mildly abnormal Pap smears. The timing of referral ranged from 3-30 months.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cytologic follow-up of women with low grade Pap smear abnormalities will identify a large number whose smears will regress to normal. A small but significant proportion of women showed subsequent HSIL. Most HSIL was detected within 1 year of the initial abnormal Pap smear and the majority of intervening Pap smears also were abnormal. Approximately one third of patients did not have follow-up within the study system and their outcome was uncertain. Although the recommendations are standard, patterns of follow-up and referral to colposcopy varied widely, suggesting that the guidelines need to be reinforced to both patients and physicians.

There was also 1 mg/dl of glucose (blood glucose, 102 mg/dl) and 706 mg/dl of protein in her cerebrospinal fluid. Empirically, vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) and ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day) were started. Following 5 days of antibiotic treatment, penicillin-susceptible S.pneumoniae was yielded in her CSF culture and identified as serotype 24B. S.pneumoniae with the same antibiotic sensitivity was also identified in her blood culture. Since rhinorrhea was observed on day 16 of hospitalization, she underwent an operation to repair the fistula tract. A computerized tomography cranial scan was performed after the development of acute mental fog at postoperative day 3 and showed brain edema and a thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery. The patient died on day 42 of hospitalization due to multiple organ failure. To our knowledge, this is the first case of meningitis reported in our country associated with S.pneumoniae serotype 24B in a patient with a cochlear implant. While there has been a decrease in the prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease with routine administration of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a relative increase has been observed in its non-vaccine serotypes. This is relevant not only to patients with more risk factors, such as a cochlear implant, but also those who are at lower risk for pneumococcal infection.", "label": 1}

Recently, sonographic measurement of the fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) has been shown to be an accurate non-invasive test to predict low fetal hemoglobin levels. We present a case report of Rh-alloimmunized pregnancy with moderate fetal anemia, followed-up by weekly MCA-PSV measurements.CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old Rh (-) negative gravida 3, para 1, without anti-D gammaglobolin prophylaxis in her previous pregnancies, presented at 27+0 weeks of gestation (w.g.) for a routine third trimester scan. Subsequent ultrasound measurements of MCA-PSV confirmed a progressive increase of the peak systolic velocities from 40 to 80 cm/sec, as well as a gradual rise in the anti-D titers. The evidence of developing fetal anemia necessitated elective Caesarean section performed at 35 wg. The neonate was admitted in the intensive care unit and required resuscitation, one exchange blood transfusion and several courses of phototherapy. The patient was discharged two weeks post partum.CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong correlation between the high peak systolic velocities in the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PSV) and the low levels of fetal hemoglobin. The high sensitivity and positive predictive value concerning the development of fetal anemia, as well as its good repeatability, makes this non-invasive test a valuable asset in the management of all pregnancies complicated by severe Rh-alloimmunization.", "label": 0}

Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her blood group is A, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. Anti-D IgG was administered. ", "knowledge": "The first case of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) possibly caused by anti-Di(a) in a Chinese infant in Taiwan is reported. The mother had two pregnancies before but no history of blood transfusion. Her first male infant was normal, but her second full-term male one developed mild jaundice soon after birth, and the total bilirubin level was 12.1 mg/dL, 18.3 mg/dL, 23.6 mg/dL at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours of age, respectively. Total bilirubin was 9.1 mg/dL on the eighth day after receiving phototherapy and compatible blood exchange transfusion. The infant recovered uneventfully. The immunohematological study revealed that the mother was group AB, Rh (D)+; Di(a - b+), the father was group O, Rh (D)+; Di(a + b+), the infant boy and his 2-year-old brother were group B, Rh(D)+; Di(a + b+). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) on the infant red cells was positive (4+ with polyspecific AHG; 4+ with anti-IgG). The maternal serum and infant's eluate from red blood cells showed negative reactions in routine antibody detection tests, but they contained alloantibody reacting against the Di(a+) cells by the manual polybrene test (MP) and indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) in AHG phase. The anti-Di(a) titers in the mother's serum was MP 1:256 and AHG 1:256, and in the infant's eluate was MP 1:128 and AHC 1:64 against Di(a + b+) cells. Based on the above results we conclude that the jaundice in this newborn baby was caused by maternal anti-Di(a) which was most likely induced by previous pregnancy. In conclusion, Diego blood group is a system of high value in anthropology because it accounts for the Mongoloid origin of American Indians, Japanese and Chinese. Anti-Di(a) may cause HDN, as in our case of HDN due to maternal anti-Di(a) in a Chinese infant. But in Europe and America, where practically all people are Di(a - b+) phenotypes, the system seems of no interest in parental studies as well as in blood transfusions. Owing to the Di(a) antigen is of higher incidence in Chinese population, we suggest that the Diego system should be involved in routine compatibility testing or antibody identification problems in parental studies and in blood transfusions in Taiwan.", "label": 1}

", "knowledge": "PURPOSE: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a disease in which serous detachment of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal pigment epithelium. Associations have been drawn between high-stress personality types and steroid exposure. This article aims to describe a unique case series of two husband and wife couples with CSC.METHODS: All methods were approved by the authors' institution's institutional review board. History, physical examination, and imaging data were obtained from the electronic medical records of the patients in question and from the providers who cared for these patients.RESULTS: Couple 1: A 35-year-old man presented with \"dark spots\" in his right eye. He reported no recent steroid use. Visual acuity at presentation was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. On fundus examination, there was subretinal fluid in the right eye. His wife presented on the same day with a \"wavy section\" in the right eye for 6 weeks. She also had no recent steroid use. Visual acuity at presentation was 20/20 in both eyes with blunting of the foveal reflex in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography showed a thick choroid with a pigment epithelial detachment in the right eye. Couple 2: A 34-year-old man presented with \"blurry vision\" in his right eye for one month. He was taking oral and nasal steroids for chronic sinusitis. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green confirmed the diagnosis of CSC. After 3 months of persistent subretinal fluid, he received photodynamic therapy in the right eye. Three days after his photodynamic therapy, his 38-year-old wife presented with subjective blurring in both eyes. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, but optical coherence tomography showed thick choroid in both eyes, a large central pigment epithelial detachment in the right eye, and 3 small pigment epithelial detachments in the left eye. She had no history of steroid use but did admit to high stress recently.CONCLUSION: All the patients in this case series were diagnosed with CSC. This is the first series to describe the simultaneous occurrence of CSC in spouses. Possible explanations for these presentations may include shared external stressors or secondary steroid exposure. Clinicians may consider inquiring about family members or cohabitants with similar symptoms if CSC is suspected.", "label": 1}

Bronchial asthma was diagnosed, however, she responded poorly despite the adequate anti-asthma therapy including high dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting beta2-agonist, theophylline and montelukast. Then chest computed tomography (CT) was performed which showed a polypoid mass occupying the lumen of left main bronchus. Then the bronchoscopy revealed a polypoid endo-bronchial mass arising from the left main bronchus, causing subtotal obstruction of the lumen. Biopsy was carried out through the bronchoscopy, the pathological findings showed characteristic cribriform and tubular pattern which was formed by two-layered cells with ductal and myoepithelial phenotypes, which were consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma. Re-examining the patient, the lung was clear without any wheeze when she was seated. However, inspiratory wheeze was heard in her left upper lung when she was supine, and disappeared after sitting up again. Subsequently the patient underwent a resection surgery. At the operational site, the tumor was seen on the anterolateral wall of the left main bronchus, without submucosally expanding histologically. Therefore, a sleeve resection surgery of the left main bronchus was performed. Following surgery, chest CT scan revealed complete resolution of the tumor.

After 2 days of therapy, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) reporting worsening symptoms; he had a blood glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL. Because he had not eaten well for several days, the patient discontinued his oral antidiabetic medications prior to presenting to the ED, but continued to take gatifloxacin. The patient had never before experienced a symptomatic hypoglycemic episode during the years of taking his antidiabetic medications. In the ED, he received 1 last dose of gatifloxacin and was treated aggressively with intravenous dextrose. By the end of his hospitalization, antidiabetic medication was restarted to control hyperglycemia.DISCUSSION: Although gatifloxacin has been shown to alter glucose homeostasis, the mechanism of action has not been elucidated. Other recognized risk factors that contribute to the development of hypoglycemia are discussed. Our patient experienced hypoglycemia after receiving gatifloxacin and recovered 24 hours after discontinuation. The Naranjo probability scale suggests a possible drug-related event.CONCLUSIONS: The temporal relationship of gatifloxacin administration and the hypoglycemic episode suggests that gatifloxacin likely precipitated the event. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse effect in patients taking gatifloxacin presenting with hypoglycemia.", "label": 1}

His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10(3)/microL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/microL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD4 count of 8 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, and a PO2 of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Rocuronium bromide and cisatracurium besylate are considered relatively recently introduced non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the enhancement of cisatracurium and rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block during anesthesia with 1.5 MAC sevoflurane or total i.v. anesthesia (TIVA), hemodynamic effects and side effects.METHODOLOGY: 80 patients were randomly allocated into one of four equal Groups to receive either rocuronium (under sevoflurane or propofol TIVA) or cisatracurium (under sevoflurane or propofol TIVA). The NMB effects ofrocuronium and cisatracurium were studied by constructing dose-effect curves. Acceleromyography (TOF-Guard) and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve were used (2 Hz every 15 sec). Cisatracurium and rocuronium were administered in increments until depression of T1/T0 > 95% was reached. Hemodynamic effects of both muscle relaxants together with sevoflurane or propofol were assessed using thoracic bioimpendance.RESULTS: Depression ofT1/T0 was enhanced under sevoflurane compared to TIVA. ED50 and ED95 values of both drugs were significantly lower under sevoflurane more than TIVA. Recovery index 25-75% and time to a TOF ration of 0.70 were prolonged significantly by sevoflurane compared to TIVA. Hemodynamically, rocuronium and cisatracurium did not exert significant changes, but the interaction of the relaxants and the anesthetic agents resulted in statistically significant decline in some hemodynamic parameters at certain periods which are not clinically significant and required no medications.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the effects of rocuronium and cisatracurium are significantly enhanced during sevoflurane compared with propofol anesthesia and the recovery is lower.", "label": 0}

Pain was evaluated with a modification of the McGill pain inventory. A subset of questions evaluated the length of time until usual activities were resumed, anxiety level, and general acceptance of the procedure including set-up, operative time, and recovery time until discharge. Overall, there was a high degree of patient acceptance and satisfaction with OLULA; however, women with CPP experienced greater intraoperative and postoperative pain than those with infertility. Some patients with CPP had a generalized visceral hypersensitivity to pain; all areas of the pelvis and bowel were sensitive, and pain was not completely blocked with local anesthesia. Average procedure length was similar for the two groups. Patients with CPP required greater postoperative analgesia and took longer to return to work. Conscious pain mapping identified a focal source of pain in three patients and generalized visceral hypersensitivity in a majority of patients with CPP. Neither of these were found in patients with infertility. Compared with traditional laparoscopy there was almost an 80% reduction in costs.CONCLUSION: Office laparoscopy under local anesthesia is safe and effective for the evaluation of patients with CPP and is less expensive than traditional laparoscopy. Although the procedure is better tolerated by women undergoing infertility evaluation, it was well tolerated by both groups. Conscious pain mapping helps identify potential areas of pelvic pain and helps further characterize patients with CPP.", "label": 1}

His medical history was significant for extensive thromboses over a period of six months. He had recently been discharged from the hospital for suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) while on enoxaparin. A venous duplex scan revealed two new deep venous thromboses in the left common, superficial, and popliteal veins. The patient was admitted and initiated on aspirin 325 mg and warfarin sodium 2 mg daily. Intravenous lepirudin with an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 60-80 seconds was also started. Because of his recurrent thrombotic event, a new International Normalized Ratio (INR) goal of 3.0-3.5 was established for warfarin therapy. Eighteen days after admission, the patient's INR and aPTT were high; therefore, his warfarin dose was reduced and i.v. lepirudin was changed to subcutaneous administration. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and, 5 days later, he developed melena. During the 7 days of treatment with subcutaneous lepirudin, a drop in platelet counts was observed. Subcutaneous lepirudin was discontinued after resolution of melena, and i.v. lepirudin was restarted. After 15 days, his platelet counts increased and he was switched back to subcutaneous lepirudin, which again led to a drop in platelets. After 27 days in the ICU, the patient's INR and aPTT remained high. Lepirudin was discontinued and i.v. bivalirudin was initiated. His platelet count increased and he was discharged.

This syndrome has been described in adults and adolescents; we report here a case in a child.OBSERVATION: This 10-year-old girl was admitted at night to our hospital after a 3-m fall at home. She was alert (Glasgow score, 15) at admission; a frontal wound and a deformation of the right wrist were noted. Brain CT scans showed a frontal skull fracture and frontal lobe contusion, wrist x-rays showed a displaced right fracture. The patient underwent urgent neurosurgery (wound excision and suture after reduction of skull fracture) and closed reduction and immobilization of the wrist fracture, both under general anesthesia. She underwent a psychiatric assessment in the intensive care unit 3days after her fall. She was alert, well-oriented in time and space, and spoke fluently. She had no memory of her fall, only remembering going to bed in the evening before the accident and waking up in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. She displayed no sign of a concurrent mental illness and no suicidal ideas. Her parents reported that the evening of the accident she and her two brothers had all fallen asleep about 11:00pm while watching TV, in the double bed of the guest room, placed just beside its window. At approximately 1:00am, her father, who was going to bed and had just made noise in the hall, heard a cry from the guest room. He entered the room immediately and saw the opened window and his daughter lying on the outside ground; the brothers only awakened after the fall. The family had returned 2days before from a 6-month stay in the United States, with jet-lag, sleep deprivation, and a disorganized sleep/wake rhythm in the patient. There was no medication before the accident, no substance use (including caffeine), and no concurrent medical problem. Over the 2preceding years, the patient had undergone two witnessed episodes of early-nighttime arousal with altered consciousness and calm wandering (including going downstairs on one occasion), both strongly suggesting sleepwalking. There was a history of sleepwalking in her father and her older brother. Life-threatening sleepwalking (Elpenor syndrome) was diagnosed. The child and her parents were educated about sleepwalking; regularization of sleep schedules and sleep extension (avoidance of sleep deprivation, short napping when possible) were prescribed. We also recommended securing the home (bed, windows, and stairways). No pharmacological treatment was instituted. During the following 18months, the child manifested only one noted sleepwalking episode, without risk-taking. She had no neurological or psychopathological sequela from her accident, of which she never had a memory.CONCLUSION: Elpenor syndrome can occur in a child; consequently, it is important to inform parents of children with sleepwalking about the necessity of always securing the night-time environment.", "label": 0}

On admission to the hospital his oral temperature was 38 degrees C, pulse was 90/min, respiratory rate was 24/min, and blood pressure was 134/80mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds and mild tenderness. Chest x ray revealed cardiomegaly. The electrocardiogram demonstrated atrial fibrillation. A plain film of the abdomen was positive for gallstones and edema of the bowel wall (thumb-printing). Laboratory results included blood urea nitrogen 48mg%, creatinine 1.2mg%, hemoglobin 18g/dl, and hematocrit 52.9%. White blood cell count was 11,900 cells/cc with 33% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 47% bands, 8% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes, and 1% atypical lymphocytes. The prime considerations for differential diagnosis were mesenteric ischemia and infectious gastroenteritis.

Furthermore, the clinical findings were only \"suggestive\" of mesenteric eschemia. They were certainly not \"diagnostic.\" In view of this dilemma, a consultation with the Division of Clinical Decision Making was requested.", "label": 0}

He was apparently well, except for left Bell's palsy which developed on May 9 of 1994, for which he received stellate ganglion block on the left side more than ten times until July 2nd of 1994, when he noted pain in his left shoulder and in his lumbar region. On July 5th, he noted some difficulty in urination. On July 6th, he noted tingling sensation in his four extremities and difficulty in gait. He was admitted to another hospital where he was treated with intravenous infusion of glycerol. After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar.

His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom. His parents have always described him as a \"difficult child.\" He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met.

Patient was then treated with oral opioids (morphine and hydrocodone with acetaminophen) in escalating doses that produced cognitive impairment. After an opioid rotation was attempted, by switching morphine to transdermal fentanyl, there was no pain reduction or improved quality of life.

His self-reported Visual Analogue Scale pain scores decreased from an average of 8/10 to 2/10 or less. Patient's overall function and participation in home activities increased. Buprenorphine is a partial -receptor and a - receptor antagonist known to block NMDA receptors and reduce hyperalgesia secondary to central sensitization.(1) Buprenorphine is also a partial agonist at the opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor, which is found to be analgesic and antinociceptive at the level of the spinal cord.(1,2) The difference in analgesic responses between buprenorphine and other opioids may be due to different receptor G protein interactions and/or selective activation of neuronal K(ATP) channels by buprenorphine.(3) Deficient opening of K(ATP) channels has been shown to mediate neuropathic pain(4); therefore, activation of these channels by buprenorphine may contribute to its analgesic effect in neuropathic pain states wherein other opioids fail. More recently, there have been two case reports in which patients with neuropathic pain of different central etiology were successfully treated with buprenorphine.(5) Despite advances in understanding the pathology related to central pain, effective treatment options are limited.

Antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir, emtricitabine, raltegravir) had been started 2 months ago. Previously he had no opportunistic infections and no other pre-existing illnesses. He had not travelled outside Europe but stayed in Spain for several weeks during summer.INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination revealed swelling of the lips and severe ulcerative mucositis of the gums and pharynx. The patient complained of painful swallowing. The blood-chemistry showed no abnormalities. The microscopical analysis of a smear and a biopsy of the buccal mucosa revealed amastigotes of leishmania. By means of PCR technique, Leishmania donovani complex was specified.TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg) for 21 days. Because of the immunosuppression he was put on maintenance therapy afterwards (liposomal amphotericin B every 3 weeks). However, 4 months later there was a clinical relapse of the mucositis and a new cultural and PCR detection of leishmania in a buccal biopsy. After another course of 21 days with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg) and miltefosine (150 mg/d), the mucositis subsided. Therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg single dose every 3 weeks) has since been maintained. The antiretroviral therapy was changed meanwhile to lamivudin, abacavir and raltegravir because of kidney failure with elevated urea and creatinine.

Clinical manifestations can be atypical in immunosuppressed patients and the treatment is complicated with HIV coinfection. This is also due to a lifelong persistence of the parasite with potential reactivation especially in patients with suppressed CD4 cells. Therefore maintenance therapy after standard therapy of leishmaniasis is mandatory at least for a CD4 count below 350/l. Especially in HIV patients with a leishmaniasis relapse lifelong maintenance therapy should be considered.", "label": 0}

This approach does not adequately assess the anti-biofilm effects of drugs, while the results of studying the interaction of drugs with biofilm components can ensure their most correct choice. The aim of investigation was to study the possibility of applying the original modification of the current method to determine the ratio of the cellular part and the matrix of biofilms of gram-positive microorganisms. The biofilm components were analyzed using a two-step approach, when prepared biofilms of gram-positive microorganisms were stained with crystal violet for 5 minutes, followed by fixing the dye in bacterial cells with iodine solution, and then the colored products were dissolved with 95% alcohol: matrix components for 1 minute, total biofilm for 15 minutes, after which the composition of biofilms was estimated by the formula: M=(OP1/OP15)?100, Kb=100-M, where M is the proportion of the matrix,%; Kb - the proportion of the cellular component,%; OP1 - optical density of samples, when alcohol was allowed to dissolve the colored product for no more than 1 minute; OP15 - was the optical density of samples, when alcohol is allowed to dissolve the colored product for 15 minutes. It was shown that in the composition of the biofilm formed by the collection strain, the proportion of the matrix was 13.2%, and the cellular component accounted for 86.8%. When the same strain cultivated in the presence of an antibiotic, an increase in the biofilm matrix was observed, which is probably due to the compensatory response of the microorganism to the action of the antibiotic.

Phenoxybenzamine was started with a dose of 10 mg daily, increased by 10 mg every 3 days to a dose of 30 mg daily; this was maintained from 3 weeks to 6 months (mean: 39 days). The pre-treatment residual urine volume ranged between 100 and 1050 mL (mean: 360 mL).

Bryan's parents report that he has always been hyperactive and oppositional since a very young age. He has been previously diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and has been treated with appropriate stimulant medications for several years; however, despite this, his parents feel increasingly unable to manage his difficult behaviors. He refuses to do chores or follow through with household routines. He refuses to go to bed at night. His family feels unable to take him to public places because he \"climbs all over everything.\" At school, he acts up in class, is often disruptive, and requires close supervision by teachers. He was recently kicked off of the school bus. He has very few friends, and his parents state that other children do not enjoy to be around him.Bryan's parents also report that he is \"obsessed\" with electronics. He spends most his free time watching TV and movies and playing computer games. He has a television in his bedroom because otherwise he \"monopolizes\" the family television. The family also owns several portable electronic devices that he frequently uses. Bryan insists on watching TV during meals and even that the TV stays on in an adjacent room while showering. He gets up early each morning and turns on the television. He refuses to leave the house unless he can take a portable screen device with him. His parents admit to difficulty placing limits on this behavior because they feel it is the only way to keep his other behaviors under control. His mother explains \"it is our only pacifier\" and that attempts to place restrictions are met with explosive tantrums and have thus been short lived. These efforts have also been impeded due to the habits of his parents and older sibling, who also enjoy spending a significant amount of time watching television.", "label": 0}

Such accidents can be life-threatening -a situation that has been termed Elpenor syndrome (in reference to an accident experienced by a character in Homer's epic The Odyssey)- in particular when entailing defenestration. This syndrome has been described in adults and adolescents; we report here a case in a child.OBSERVATION: This 10-year-old girl was admitted at night to our hospital after a 3-m fall at home. She was alert (Glasgow score, 15) at admission; a frontal wound and a deformation of the right wrist were noted. Brain CT scans showed a frontal skull fracture and frontal lobe contusion, wrist x-rays showed a displaced right fracture. The patient underwent urgent neurosurgery (wound excision and suture after reduction of skull fracture) and closed reduction and immobilization of the wrist fracture, both under general anesthesia. She underwent a psychiatric assessment in the intensive care unit 3days after her fall. She was alert, well-oriented in time and space, and spoke fluently. She had no memory of her fall, only remembering going to bed in the evening before the accident and waking up in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. She displayed no sign of a concurrent mental illness and no suicidal ideas. Her parents reported that the evening of the accident she and her two brothers had all fallen asleep about 11:00pm while watching TV, in the double bed of the guest room, placed just beside its window. At approximately 1:00am, her father, who was going to bed and had just made noise in the hall, heard a cry from the guest room. He entered the room immediately and saw the opened window and his daughter lying on the outside ground; the brothers only awakened after the fall. The family had returned 2days before from a 6-month stay in the United States, with jet-lag, sleep deprivation, and a disorganized sleep/wake rhythm in the patient. There was no medication before the accident, no substance use (including caffeine), and no concurrent medical problem. Over the 2preceding years, the patient had undergone two witnessed episodes of early-nighttime arousal with altered consciousness and calm wandering (including going downstairs on one occasion), both strongly suggesting sleepwalking. There was a history of sleepwalking in her father and her older brother. Life-threatening sleepwalking (Elpenor syndrome) was diagnosed. The child and her parents were educated about sleepwalking; regularization of sleep schedules and sleep extension (avoidance of sleep deprivation, short napping when possible) were prescribed. We also recommended securing the home (bed, windows, and stairways). No pharmacological treatment was instituted. During the following 18months, the child manifested only one noted sleepwalking episode, without risk-taking. She had no neurological or psychopathological sequela from her accident, of which she never had a memory.CONCLUSION: Elpenor syndrome can occur in a child; consequently, it is important to inform parents of children with sleepwalking about the necessity of always securing the night-time environment.", "label": 1}

While in flight, she experienced sudden onset of epigastric and midsternal chest pain with shortness of breath. Her symptoms improved markedly after she received oxygen on board, and she finished the flight without further incident. Once home later that night, the pain recurred, and she was taken to the hospital. Her history included chronic pain syndrome, hypertension, and refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, for which she had undergone radiofrequency ablation on two occasions. Her most recent ablation was 1 month prior. Upon arrival in the emergency department, her vital signs were within normal limits, and an electrocardiogram was unchanged from baseline. A chest radiograph obtained at the time of physical examination was unchanged from baseline. Given her recent travel history, there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism. Ventilation-perfusion imaging and lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography were performed (images not shown) and revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or lower extremity thrombus. Because of the patient's clinical stability and because her symptoms had improved, she declined admission for observation and returned home against medical advice. The patient returned to the emergency department 2 days later in severe distress, with unstable vital signs, a jaundiced appearance, and substantial pain in her chest and abdomen. Her creatinine level was 4.4 mg/dL (388.9 mol/L) (increased from 0.9 mg/dL [79.6 mol/L] 2 days prior). Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained and indicated increasing pericardial effusion. Bedside echocardiography enabled confirmation of these radiographic findings, and pericardiocentesis was performed. The patient's condition immediately improved, and she was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit. Her symptoms recurred 3 days later, and a pericardial drain was placed. Fluid cultures were preliminarily positive for enterococcus and gram-negative rods. After drain placement, she was scheduled for definitive treatment of recurrent symptomatic effusion. The preoperative work-up included a water-soluble contrast material-enhanced (iodixanol, 320 mg of iodine per milliliter) esophagram with computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed immediately thereafter.

Some patients may experience excessive tongue protrusion, squinting, muddled speech, or uncontrollable contraction of the platysma muscle. A 44-year-old Japanese male was suffering from schizophrenia. The initial presentation of his psychosis consisted of auditory hallucinations, delusions of persecution, psychomotor excitement, loosening association, and restlessness. After being prescribed several antipsychotic drugs, risperidone was started and gradually increased to 4 mg/day. The above symptoms were relieved, particularly auditory hallucination and excitement were promptly improved. Persecutory delusion, however persisted, and deteriorated. At one year after the start of this risperidone regimen, he exhibited severe blepharospasm symptoms (increased rate of eye blinking, light sensitivity) and oromandibular symptoms (trismus, jaw pain, dysarthria).

Morbidity and mortality from acute OP toxicity correlate best with pulmonary secretions.OBJECTIVE: In this article, we report bilateral loculated pleural effusion as a rare pulmonary effect in a patient with acute parenteral OP toxicity.CASE REPORT: A 25-year-old, previously healthy woman was transferred to our Poison Department 3 days after suicidal injection of malathion. At the time of presentation her vital signs were normal, except that her respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min. She complained of pleuritic chest pain and had a cough productive of yellow sputum. She had generalized chest wall tenderness, and breath sounds were decreased in the base of both lung fields. Standard therapy for OP toxicity, including atropine, pralidoxime, and diazepam, was initiated. Due to persistent pleuritic chest pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed that showed bilateral loculated pleural effusions. Shortly after hospital admission, the patient developed respiratory distress, for which she was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. She received continued medical therapy and was extubated on hospital day 3. A CT scan of the chest on hospital day 9, after completion of the treatment, documented resolution of the effusions.CONCLUSION: Parenteral OP toxicity occurs rarely, and in this case it was associated with bilateral loculated pleural effusions. In this regard, it should be considered in a patient with acute parenteral OP toxicity and persistent chest wall pain.", "label": 1}

Peripheral leukocytosis of 160 x 10(9)/L, splenomegaly and fatigue suggested CML.

Cytogenetics performed on peripheral blood cells revealed the characteristic t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation as solitary abnormality. Analyzing the bone marrow biopsy a focal nodular B-lymphoid blast component was additionally seen. BCR-ABL FISH analysis demonstrated 31% atypical split signals in the B-lymphoid blasts and in the maturing myeloid cells, furthermore, BCR-ABL fusion transcripts were seen in the RT-PCR assay. Imatinib-based therapy led to temporary regression of peripheral leukocytosis. Bone marrow examination 3 weeks after therapy induction demonstrated considerably reduced cellularity and the proportion of B-lymphoid blasts had decreased to 20% of the nuclear cells. BCR-ABL FISH analysis still presented 21% atypical split signals but levels of BCR-ABL transcripts had significantly fallen indicating a rather favourable prognosis. However, 3 months after diagnosis the patient relapsed and developed an immunodeficiency with soor esophagitis and aspergillus pneumonia. A therapy with dasatinib was not successful and the patient died in consequence of immunodeficiency. This report demonstrates the high diagnostic value of bone marrow biopsy in the evaluation of CML.

To test this hypothesis, we performed a dose-escalating 3-month-trial of ATRA in 15 patients with primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Morphologic diagnoses were refractory anemia (RA) in 4, RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS) in 2, RA with excess blasts (RAEB) in 7, and RAEB in transformation (RAEB/T) in 2 cases. Patients included were required to have one or more of the following criteria: transfusion-dependent anemia, pronounced neutropenia (< or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L) or thrombocytopenia (< or = 20 x 10(9)/L), or increasing blast cells in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Therapy was started at an ATRA dose of 30 mg/m2/d, administered orally as two doses of 15 mg/m2 every 12 hours. The retinoid dose was increased to 60 mg/m2/d after 4 weeks and to 90 mg/m2/d after 8 weeks. Among 14 patients assessable for response, none obtained a complete or partial remission. Three patients had a minor response, manifested by either reduction in transfusion requirements (2 patients) or increase in neutrophil and platelet counts (1 patient). During the study period, 5 patients progressed to more advanced stages of MDS or overt leukemia. Three patients with chromosomal abnormalities receiving ATRA for a period of 10 to 12 weeks retained their cytogenetic marker after completion of treatment. Side effects of ATRA primarily affected the skin and mucous membranes, with 13 of 15 patients having at least low-grade dermatologic toxicity. In 2 cases, treatment had to be prematurely stopped because of intolerable conjunctivitis or progressive neurologic symptoms. These data suggest that ATRA has little effect on MDS. The lack of response of MDS patients, as compared with those with APL, may be attributed to the absence of the t(15;17) translocation that seems to be a prerequisite for clinical efficacy of ATRA.", "label": 0}

His medical history was significant for a gunshot wound to the head 3 years prior, with a residual seizure disorder. He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 50/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days). Nine days later, ivermectin (4.5 mg once daily for 3 days for 2 courses) was also added. He continued to clinically deteriorate.

His living space is not provided with running water nor drainage. He has contact with sheep and bovines. Started presenting symptoms two years before. Suffered from myalgia, joint pain, fever of 38 degrees C and epigastric pain that radiated the hypocondrium and the right shoulder. He had diarrhea five times in 24 hours as well as lack of appetite that lead to a weight loss of 20 kilograms in two years. He was hospitalized and the physical examination revealed diminished muscular mass, right hypocondrium pain and hepatomegaly of 3 cm below costal margin. He said he ate watercress (Nasturium officinalis) two or three times a week. Blood test revealed erythrocytes of 3.6 x 105 mm3; hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL; hematocrit of 30%; leukocytes 8950 mm3; neutrophils 65%; lymphocytes of 30%; eosinophils of 3%; monocytes of 1% and basophiles of 1%. Globular sedimentation was 83 mm and hemoglobin concentration was 33. Liver test results were normal and mycobacterium in fecal samples was negative, but stool detection tests revealed eggs of Fasciola hepatica. The diagnosis was hepatic fasciolosis in its biliar stage. Dehidrohemetine (1.5 mg/kg) was administered during 10 days. Symptoms disappeared within 48 hours.CONCLUSION: The lack of knowledge about fasciolosis makes it hard to diagnose it.

On July 5th, he noted some difficulty in urination. On July 6th, he noted tingling sensation in his four extremities and difficulty in gait. He was admitted to another hospital where he was treated with intravenous infusion of glycerol. After this treatment, his gait and sensory disturbance showed some improvement, however, on July 7th, his shoulder and lumbar pain worsened, and he became unable to stand. His temperature went up to 39 degrees C on the next day. Lumbar CSF on that day contained 119 cells/microliters, 112 mg/dl of protein, and 53 mg/dl of sugar.

He was operated on several times on osteomyelitis. He had been treated on his tooth ache until shortly before the onset of the present illness. He also received steroid hormone for his Bell's palsy. On admission, his consciousness varied from alert to stupor. His BP was 150/100 mmHg, HR 98/min and regular, BT 39.4 degrees C. The bulbar conjunctiva appeared somewhat icteric. Otherwise, general physical examination was unremarkable. On neurologic examination, there was no apparent dementia. Higher cerebral functions appeared intact. The optic discs were flat. Pupils were round and isocoric reacting to light and accommodation promptly. Ocular movements were full without nystagmus. Some exophthalmos was noted bilaterally. The sensation of the face and facial muscles were intact. The remaining cranial nerves also appeared intact. Nuchal rigidity was present. He was unable to stand or walk. Muscle strength was markedly diminished in all four limbs; manual muscle testing revealed 1 to 2/5 weakness in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Muscle stretch reflexes were decreased or lost in both upper and lower limbs, but the plantar response was extensor on the right. Sensation appeared to be diminished in legs, but detail was not clear because of disturbance of consciousness. Pertinent laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 12,800/microliter, GPT 58 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.65 mg/dl, and CRP 16.8 mg/dl.

The authors report a case of AAC that occurred immediately after administering intravitreal bevacizumab to treat branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old woman was referred to the retina clinic of a tertiary referral center for the treatment of macular edema secondary to BRVO. On slit lamp examination, anterior chamber (AC) depth was shallow (3 corneal thicknesses centrally, 1/4 corneal thicknesses peripherally) in both eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 19mmHg in both eyes, and refractive error was +1.00 diopter sphere in both eyes. A gonioscopy exam demonstrated narrow angle of over 180 in both eyes. To treat the macular edema, bevacizumab was injected into her right eye intravitreally. After two bevacizumab injections, the macular edema regressed but recurred 5months later, and thus, a third injection was performed. The next day, she visited our emergency department complaining of persistent ocular pain in her right eye. The right pupil had dilated to 6mm diameter and was fixed. Slit lamp exam revealed diffuse corneal edema in her right eye, which had an IOP of 56mmHg. After administration of intravenous mannitol, the IOP fell to 14mmHg and the corneal edema disappeared. Subsequently, a glaucoma specialist performed laser iridotomy on the right eye.CONCLUSIONS: Although AAC is a rare complication of intravitreal injection, it can occur in a patient with risk factors such as hyperopic eye or narrow angle.", "label": 0}

Missing this diagnosis can lead to permanent vision loss due to injury of the optic nerve. Patients may present with preseptal inflammation, lid edema, chemosis, or ophthalmoplegia.OBJECTIVE: We report a case of acute sphenoid sinusitis in a 10-year-old child who presented to the Emergency Department with essentially painless vision loss.CASE REPORT: Previously healthy, the patient reported progressive decrease in vision in her right eye for the 5 days prior. Other than blurred vision in the right eye, she complained of a mild frontal headache and right eye irritation the past week, which had abated. On examination, she was reading a book with her head tilted to one side. She had no photophobia, or facial or eyelid swelling. Her pupils were 5 mm bilaterally, but the right was non-reactive to light. She was unable to see two fingers 6 inches in front of her face (right eye), whereas her visual acuity on the left was 20/25. She had bilateral elevated intraocular pressures and a Marcus Gunn pupil on the right. Ophthalmology was consulted and the diagnosis of acute sphenoid sinusitis causing compression and vascular compromise to the optic nerve was diagnosed ultimately by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was transferred to the nearest pediatric specialty hospital, where an emergent endoscopic sphenoidotomy was performed. The patient's vision subsequently returned.CONCLUSION: Sphenoid sinusitis should be considered in patients presenting with acute vision loss.

His mother made the appointment for a health supervision visit although she had concerns about his language and social skills. She stated that he spoke primarily with unintelligible sounds and often communicated by pointing with his finger. He spoke only 10 words that were clear enough to be understood. Jimmy's mother said that he could hear, but she was not sure whether he understood everything she said. Although he played at home with his 4-year-old brother, he typically played by himself when he was in the presence of other children. Jimmy's mother was asked if he had had a 2-year-old visit to a pediatrician and what the assessment was at that time. She said that his delayed development was discussed with the pediatrician, but she was reassured that he would progress during the following year. An uncomplicated full-term gestation was followed by a vaginal delivery without perinatal problems. Jimmy was a \"calm\" baby who was breastfed for the first 6 months of life. He sat at 7 months, pulled himself up to stand with support at approximately 9 months, and walked at 13 months. Transitions were always difficult for Jimmy; he screamed and was difficult to settle whenever cared for by someone other than his parents. He typically resists physical contact when children or adults approach him. His mother recalled that language emerged early. He acquired a significant number of words between 12 and 15 months of age. Jimmy apparently recognized letters when his parents were teaching the older sibling. At 15 months, Jimmy's language output regressed dramatically, and by 18 months, he no longer used words to communicate. Since then, he has spoken fewer than 10 single words. He mostly babbles and uses repetitions of the same sounds. The pediatrician inquired into family structure and life events at the time Jimmy lost language milestones. He was told that, at this time, the father, an engineer, changed his position in the company and began to travel extensively. Jimmy's mother thought that the absence of his father might be related to the language regression. She also noted that Jimmy seemed to have a stronger attachment for his father: \"Jimmy has always been attracted to his father, and his brother seems to prefer me.\" The parents' marriage was strong and free of any major disharmony. During the interview, the pediatrician noted that Jimmy played persistently with his set of small trains, repetitiously lining them up in order. He was not interested in other toys that were on the floor next to him. He ran around the trains, mostly on his toes, while making unintelligible sounds. He looked away when the pediatrician called his name and became agitated when his mother attempted to redirect his attention to the examination. The pediatrician, 4 years in practice after his residency, had never seen a child with Jimmy's pattern of development.

The disorder is included under anxiety disorders because it shares some obsessive-compulsive features. Patients have the tendency towards feelings of unattractiveness, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (1,2). It is a major psychiatric problem, but many patients with this disorder first present to a dermatologist. An 11-year-old girl came to our department with a 2-month history of diffuse hair loss on the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area (Figure 1). She had originally been examined by a pediatrician with the diagnosis of alopecia areata. The patient`s personal history included hay fever and shortsightedness, and she suffered from varicella and mononucleosis. Nobody in the family history suffered from alopecia areata, but her father has male androgenetic alopecia (Norwood/Hamilton MAGA C3F3). The mother noticed that the child had had changeable mood for about 2 months and did not want to communicate with other persons in the family. The family did not have any pet at home. At school, her favorite subjects were Math and Computer Studies. She did not like Physical Education and did not participate in any sport activities during her free time. This was very strange because she was obese (body-mass index (BMI) 24.69). She was sometimes angry with her 13-year-old sister who had better results at school. The girl had suddenly started to wear a blue scarf. The parents did not notice that she pulled out her hair at home. Dermatological examination of the capillitium found a zone of incomplete alopecia in the frontoparietal and parietotemporal area, without inflammation, desquamation, and scaring. Hairs were of variable length (Figure 1). There was a patch of incomplete alopecia above the forehead between two stripes of hair of variable length (Figure 2). The hair pull test was negative along the edges of the alopecia. Mycological examination from the skin capillitium was negative. The trichoscopy and skin biopsy of the parietotemporal region of the capillitium (Figure 3) confirmed trichotillomania. Laboratory tests (blood count, iron, ferritin, transferrin, selenium, zinc, vitamin B12, folic acid, serology and hormones of thyroid gland) were negative. We referred the girl for ophthalmologic and psychological examination. Ophthalmologic examination proved that there was no need to add any more diopters. The psychological examination provided us with a picture in which she drew her family (Figure 4). The strongest authority in the family was the mother because she looked after the girls for most of the day. She was in the first place in the picture. The father had longer working hours and spent more time outside the home. He worked as a long vehicle driver. He was in the second place in the picture. There was sibling rivalry between the girls, but the parents did not notice this problem and preferred the older daughter. She was successful at school and was prettier (slim, higher, curly brown hair, without spectacles). Our 11-years-old patient noticed all these differences between them, but at her level of mental development was not able to cope with this problem. She wanted to be her sister's equal. The sister is drawn in the picture in the third place next to father, while the patient's own figure was drawn larger and slim even though she was obese. Notably, all three female figures had very nice long brown hair. It seemed that the mother and our patient had better quality of hair and more intense color than the sister in the drawing. The only hairless person in the picture was the father. The girl did not want to talk about her problems and feelings at home. Then it was confirmed that our patient was very sensitive, anxious, willful, and withdrawn. She was interested in her body and very perceptive of her physical appearance. From the psychological point of view, the parents started to pay more interest to their younger daughter and tried to understand and help her. After consultation with the psychiatrist, we did not start psychopharmacologic therapy for trichotillomania; instead, we started treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, mild shampoo, mild topical steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%) in solution and methionine in capsules. With parents' cooperation, the treatment was successful. The name trichotillomania was first employed by the French dermatologist Francois Henri Hallopeau in 1889, who described a young man pulling his hair out in tufts (3-5). The word is derived from the Greek thrix (hair), tillein (to pull), and mania (madness) (5). The prevalence of TTM in the general adult population ranges from 0.6% to 4%, and 2-4% of the general psychiatric outpatient population meet the criteria for TTM (2-5). The prevalence among children and adolescents has been estimated at less than 1% (5). The disease can occur at any age and in any sex. The age of onset of hair pulling is significantly later for men than for women (3). There are three subsets of age: preschool children, preadolescents to young adults, and adults. The mean age of onset is pre-pubertal. It ranges from 8 to 13 years (on average 11.3 years) (2-5). The occurrence of hair-pulling in the first year of life is a rare event, probably comprising <1% of cases (5). The etiology of TTM is complex and may be triggered by a psychosocial stressor within the family, such as separation from an attachment figure, hospitalization of the child or parent, birth of a younger sibling, sibling rivalry, moving to a new house, or problems with school performance. It has been hypothesized that the habit may begin with \"playing\" with the hair, with later chronic pulling resulting in obvious hair loss (2). Environment is a factor because children usually pull their hair when alone and in relaxed surroundings. The bedroom, bathroom, or family room are \"high-risk\" situations for hair-pulling (5). Men and women also differed in terms of the hair pulling site (men pull hair from the stomach/back and the moustache/beard areas, while women pull from the scalp) (3). Pulling hair from siblings, pets, dolls, and stuffed animals has also been documented, often occurring in the same pattern as in the patient (5). Genetic factors contributing to the development of TTM are mutations of the SLITRK1 gene, which plays a role in cortex development and neuronal growth. The protein SAPAP3 has been present in 4.2% of TTM cases and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It may be involved in the development of the spectrum of OCD. A significantly different concordance rate for TTM was found in monozygotic (38.1%) compared with dizygotic (0%) twins in 34 pairs (3). The core diagnostic feature is the repetitive pulling of hairs from one`s own body, resulting in hair loss. The targeted hair is mostly on the scalp (75%), but may also be from the eyebrows (42%), eyelashes (53%), beard (10%), and pubic area (17%) (3,5). There are three subtypes of hair pulling - early onset, automatic, and focused. Diagnostic criteria for TTM according to DSM-IV criteria are (2,3,5): 1) recurrent pulling of one`s hair resulting in noticeable hair loss; 2) an increasing sense of tension immediately prior to pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior; 3) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair; 4) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition (e.g., a dermatologic condition); 5) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The differential diagnosis includes alopecia areata (Table 1) (6), tinea capitis, telogen effluvium, secondary syphilis, traction alopecia, loose anagen syndrome, lichen planopilaris, alopecia mucinosa, and scleroderma (2-5). Biopsy of an involved area (ideally from a recent site of hair loss) can help to confirm the diagnosis (5). On histologic examination, there are typically increased numbers of catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation. Chronic hair pulling induces a catagen phase, and more hairs will be telogen hairs. Pigment casts and empty anagen follicles are often seen. Perifollicular hemorrhage near the hair bulb is an indicator of TTM (2). Complications of TTM are rare, but they comprise secondary bacterial infections with regional lymphadenopathy as a result of picking and scratching at the scalp. Many patients play with and ingest the pulled hairs (e.g. touching the hair to lips, biting, and chewing). Trichophagia (ingestion of the hair) can lead to a rare complication named trichobezoar (a \"hair ball\" in stomach). This habit is present in approximately 5% to 30% of adult patients, but it is less frequent in children. Patient with trichophagia present with pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. Radiologic examination and gastroscopy should not be delayed (2,4,5). The management of the disease is difficult and requires strong cooperation between the physician, patient, and parents. The dermatologist cannot take part in the therapy, strictly speaking, but without the psychological, psychopharmacologic, and topic dermatologic treatment a vicious circle will be perpetuated.

She denied any chest pain, cough, fever, orthopnea, or leg swelling. She was afebrile and normotensive, and her physical examination was unremarkable. Her white blood cell count was 23,000/mm(3) with 23% eosinophils, and her troponin T level was 1.08 \u200bNg/ml. Extensive work-up revealed CSS. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should be aware of unusual cases because not every patient that walks into an emergency department has a simple case of \"asthma\" or \"allergies.\" Our patient had been diagnosed with asthma for 6months before her symptoms had progressed to a point that prompted her to seek medical attention in a hospital. Emergency physicians are in a unique position to identify patients who present with recurrent complaints of asthma-especially late-onset asthma, which gradually worsens and is refractory to usual treatment. A complete blood cell count with a differential will prove valuable. Assessments of a patient's C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are inexpensive and check for signs of inflammation, although they are nonspecific. A chest radiograph or computed tomography scan of the chest or sinuses in some patients can also prove to be of value. Prompt recognition and treatment with steroids is imperative to ablate vasculitis tissue damage because this can improve the outcome.", "label": 1}

Her endurance had improved temporarily after she began medical treatment and she was able to walk her dog for 30 minutes daily without experiencing chest pain. Her current medications include daily aspirin, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and isosorbide dinitrate four times daily. Her pulse is 55/min and blood pressure is 115/78 mm Hg.

Initial physical examination showed blood pressure of 170/80 mm Hg with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, otherwise unremarkable. Initial laboratory workup was significant for INR of 3.6, with slightly elevated troponin I and creatinine of 0.06 ng/mL and 1.4 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was admitted to the medicine floor. However, a few hours later, her atrial fibrillation went into rapid ventricular response, associated with hypotension. Cardiac enzymes began to trend up along with worsening of her renal function tests and hepatic enzymes. Her INR remained supratherapeutic despite holding coumadin and giving vitamin K. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for closer monitoring. During day 1 of the medical intensive care unit stay, losartan, simvastatin, and diuretics were held, whereas aspirin, clopidogrel, and isosorbide dinitrate were continued. In the following 2 days, there was worsening of tissue perfusion, and laboratory workup showed AST 514 IU/L, ALT 391 IU/L, INR >9, creatinine 3.8 mg/dL, and troponin I 0.19 ng/mL; therefore, digoxin was also held. Once the patient achieved hemodynamic stability, she was started on hydralazine. On day 4, renal function, cardiac, and hepatic enzymes improved significantly. However, 24 hours later, transaminases began to trend up again reaching a maximum of AST and ALT of 359 and 525 IU/L, respectively.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate whether it is possible, on the basis of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count in patients with liver cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, to determine the optimal duration of cefotaxime therapy, as the most frequently applied empirical therapy, and possibly anticipate the disease recurrence.METHODOLOGY: In 16 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and confirmed diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, cefotaxime therapy was administered 2g t.i.d. during 5 days. Before the therapy, at 48 hours, 5 days and 15-20 days after the cefotaxime therapy was started, in all patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was performed, each time determining the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count together with microbiological analysis.RESULTS: In the course of the \"primary\" spontaneous bacterial peritonitis attack, 3 patients died (18.8%). In 4 patients the recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was observed within 15-20 days after therapy was discontinued. Two patients died during the therapy of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis recurrence. After 48 hours of therapy, 11 patients with the \"primary\" spontaneous bacterial peritonitis attack were without any symptoms (68.8%). Out of these 11, 10 patients (62.5%) had the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count lower than 250/mm3. After 5 days of therapy, 12 patients (75%) were free of symptoms, and the number of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count < 250/mm3 was still found in 10 (62.5%) patients. No association between the presence of symptoms 48 hours after the therapy and the recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was established. A significant association was found between the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count determined 48 hours after the therapy and the recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A recurrence occurred in only 1 patient with the number of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count < 250/mm3, 48 hours after the therapy was started. A recurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in all the patients who had an ascitic fluid PMN cell count > or = 250/mm3, 48 hours after the therapy was started.CONCLUSIONS: By monitoring the ascitic fluid PMN cell count it seems to be possible to determine the efficacy and optimal duration of cefotaxime therapy in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis when it is of most importance that the number of ascitic fluid PMN cell count should decrease below 250/mm3 during the therapy.", "label": 1}

Samples were obtained in the prone position under local anesthesia with a 14-gauge needle and an automated high-speed gun. An average of 4.3 cores per lesion were acquired. In 68 patients (64%) an additional surgical biopsy was performed, 38 (36%) had clinical and mammographic follow-up.RESULTS: In 4 of the 106 stereotactic biopsies insufficient material for the histological examination was obtained. In the 68 core biopsies with surgical correlation there were no false-positive, but 2 false-negative results with regard to the malignancy of the lesion (sensitivity: 93.8%; specificity: 100%). The 2 false-negative results were obtained in lesions that were mammographically judged as malignant while histology of the stereotactic biopsy showed fibrosis. The stereotactic large core breast biopsy was well tolerated by all patients. No clinically significant complications occurred.CONCLUSION: The stereotactic large core breast biopsy of a mammographically suspicious lesion can be performed with a high diagnostic accuracy.

Ruling out acute coronary syndrome is essential in ensuring patient safety. Workup includes electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers. Wellens syndrome is characterized by a history of chest pain, normal or minimally elevated biomarkers, no STEMI/Q-waves, and specific ECG changes. These changes consist of biphasic T waves in lead V2 and V3 or deep symmetrically inverted T waves in leads V1-V4. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain in a background of active smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His ECG was characteristic of Wellens syndrome type 1 and negative cardiac biomarkers. His TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) score was 2, however, he failed conservative management necessitating urgent coronary angiogram. Critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was found which required 2 drug eluting stents. He was discharged home asymptomatic on optimal medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS Conventional management of patients with NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and unstable angina with risk stratification utilizing TIMI score may not be appropriate in patient with Wellens syndrome. This highlights the importance of ECG recognition and urgent percutaneous intervention in patients with Wellens syndrome. Failure to identify this clinical syndrome could result in significant morbidity and mortality because it relates to critical stenosis and imminent large myocardial infarction.", "label": 0}

We present a case of a patient with a large aspirin ingestion who expired despite aggressive hemodialysis (HD).CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Department 7.5 h after ingesting 400 tablets of 325-mg aspirin. He was afebrile, the respiratory rate (RR) was 30 breaths/min, heart rate (HR) 120 beats/min, blood pressure (BP) 125/76 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. His salicylate concentration was 89.6 mg/dL. His initial arterial blood gas: pH 7.48, pCO(2) 21 mm Hg, PaO(2) 97 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 15.8 mmol/L. His initial serum chemistry panel was normal. He received activated charcoal and intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate. Two hours after arrival, salicylate concentration was 91.6 mg/dL. The patient became agitated and HD was initiated; 22 h after presentation, repeat salicylate concentration was 88.4 mg/dL and his creatinine was 3.9 mg/dL. A second run of HD was performed. After this, his temperature had risen to 39.06C (102.3F), BP 122/64 mm Hg, HR 168 beats/min, RR 43 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95% (2 L nasal cannula). His confusion increased, and he died 40 h after his ingestion.CONCLUSION: HD is widely advocated in managing severe salicylate intoxications, however, no consensus exists for the duration and best mode of therapy. Patients with severe salicylate poisonings may require extended durations of HD to effectively mitigate toxicity. Additional study is warranted to determine optimal therapy in severe salicylate intoxications.", "label": 1}

The agitation worsened and did not respond to benzodiazepines. The patient was then given a dose of 0.6 mg physostigmine (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously with reversal of the agitation. But the effect only lasted 45 min requiring administration of a second bolus of 0.6 mg (0.02 mg/kg). A physostigmine intravenous infusion was administered at a rate of 0.5 mg/h (0.0167 mg/kg/h). Overnight, the patient became more agitated. The physostigmine was discontinued, and IV dexmedetomidine (0.2 g/kg/h) was started at 21:00. The patient became over-sedated with pinpoint pupils resulting in discontinuation of the dexmedetomidine at 04:00. The patient again became agitated and developed visual hallucinations.

The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws.

The diagnosis has always been challenging since the first case was reported in 1844. For that reason the diagnostic criteria have evolved over years to include the features of the disease more comprehensively. Unusual presentations are infrequent and a diagnostic challenge. For this reason we report this rare case in which diarrhea and abdominal pain were the initial presenting symptoms of multiple myeloma with a plasmacytoma.CASE PRESENTATION: An 87-year-old Hispanic man with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and constipation, presented to an emergency department complaining of severe generalized abdominal pain and profuse diarrhea for 3 days. A physical examination revealed generalized pallor and dehydration but no signs of abdominal peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests revealed neutrophilia and an elevated total protein. He received intravenously administered fluids and antibiotics. His abdominal pain became localized in the infraumbilical area and a small mass was palpated on the right lower quadrant on subsequent examination.

She visited our facility in November 1988 after receiving three cycles of estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy from a previous physician which caused withdrawal bleeding. Clomiphen citrate reportedly failed to induce apparent ovulation. On her first visit with us, she was 160 cm tall weighing 47 kg with apparent hoarseness but not with hirsutism.

Laparoscopic examination disclosed that her uterus appeared to be normal with bilateral ovaries relatively small (4 x 4 x 3 cm) without tumorous or polycystic appearance. Histological examination of her ovaries obtained at laparoscopy showed several primary follicles with mild infiltration of the stromal cells. No thickened tunica albuginea or cystic formation were observed. These findings did not support either polycystic ovary or hyperthecosis. Serum testosterone (T) levels were extremely high (7.1 ng/ml), while serum androstenedione levels were only slightly above normal range (3.1 ng/ml). Urine 17-KS excretion was slightly increased (6.1 mg/day), while 17-OHCS output was within normal range (4.0 mg/day). Basal serum LH and FSH levels were within normal range and LH pulse frequency was reduced to 1 in 4 hours. Administration of dexamethasone 1 mg/day for 2 days did not suppress circulating T and free T levels but lowered serum cortisol concentration and urine excretion of 17-OHCS. Blood glucose and insulin levels were within normal limits and their responses to oral glucose administration were normal. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography as well as adrenal scintigraphy did not reveal any tumorous lesions in bilateral adrenals and ovaries. Administration of GnRH agonist, Buserelin 900 micrograms/day, suppressed circulating T concentrations to 0.7 ng/ml in 8 days, while it had no significant effects on DHEA and DHEA-S levels. After 16 weeks of Buserelin administration, ovulation was successfully induced by hMG administration. Cyclic estrogen and gestagen replacement therapy by Kaufmann's schedule for 2 cycles also suppressed serum T levels to normal, female range.

", "knowledge": "OBJECTIVE: The utility of the Gram stain for the preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) in infants <or= 60 days of age has not been clearly defined. Our purpose was to assess the test characteristics of the Gram stain in febrile infants and compare them to urinalysis (UA) and microscopy.METHODS: The study was prospective and observational. Urine samples were obtained from a consecutive sample of infants <or= 60 days of age with a temperature of >or= 38.0 degrees C presenting to a pediatric emergency department during 2 consecutive winter seasons. Single pathogen growth of >or= 10(4) cfu/mL from a catheterized specimen and >or= 10(3) cfu/mL from a suprapubic specimen was considered positive. A positive Gram stain was defined as the identification of any organisms. Urinalysis was tested for the presence of nitrites and for leukocyte esterase (LE). Urine microscopy was analyzed for white blood cells per high power field (WBC/hpf).RESULTS: Fourteen of 246 patients were excluded; 11 because no Gram stain was completed. Of the remaining 232 patients, Gram stain had a sensitivity of 85.2% (95% CI 71.9-98.6%), a specificity of 99.0% (95% CI 97.7-100%), a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 87.3 (95% CI 21.8-349.9), and a likelihood ratio for a negative test of 0.15 (95% CI 0.06-0.37). There were 193 specimens for which a Gram stain and a complete UA and microscopy were completed and compared. Urine microscopy had a lower sensitivity and specificity than Gram stain for both >or= 5 WBC/hpf and >or= 10 WBC/hpf. In addition to the Gram stain, a dipstick negative for nitrites and LE had a low negative likelihood ratio (0.16), useful for decreasing the likelihood of a UTI.CONCLUSIONS: The Gram stain has excellent test characteristics for the preliminary diagnosis of a UTI in febrile infants. Patient disposition and therapy will likely change if clinical protocols and guidelines use the Gram stain rather than urine microscopy for preliminary diagnosis of UTI in infants.", "label": 1}

The patient was a full-term infant of uneventful delivery, however, motor milestones were delayed in that neck control was obtained at 10 months of the age and she started to walk unassisted at 2 years of the age. Mental development was normal. She was unable to run with her mates at her kindergarten and she required a handrail when she walk up the stairs. She could not close her mouth completely at the primary school. She was unable to use a straw as a middle school pupil. Recently, she noted difficulty in raising her head from the supine position, and has become unable to walk a long distance. She was admitted to our hospital in September 17, 1994 when she was 34-year-old. On admission, general physical examination revealed that she looked slender weighing 38 kg with 149.5 cm height. She showed a high arched palate, slight scoliosis, and pes equinus. Otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Upon neurologic examination, she was alert and well oriented. Cranial nerves were unremarkable except for bilateral facial atrophy and moderate weakness. Her voice was of nasal quality, and swallowing was slightly difficult. No atrophy was noted in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. She showed waddling gait and positive Gowers' sign. Diffuse muscle atrophy was noted and mild to moderate weakness was presented more in the proximal part in both upper and lower extremities, however, deltoid muscles retained normal power. No ataxia was noted. All the deep tendon reflexes were lost. Sensation was intact. Routine laboratory examination was unremarkable. Serum CK was 56 IU/l. Electromyography revealed myogenic changes in the deltoid, biceps, and quadriceps muscles. A diagnostic biopsy was performed in the left biceps brachii muscle. The patient was discussed in the neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had nemaline myopathy. Opinions were divided among nemaline myopathy, central core disease, and congenital fiber type disproportion. Histologic examination of the biopsied specimen revealed marked atrophy of type 1 muscle fibers; many central nuclei were seen in the type 1 fibers. Approximately 70% of the muscle fibers were type 1 fibers. No nemaline rods or central cores were noted.

Results suggested that while participants did believe that it was much more common for their male friends and for typical male students to aggress against unfaithful girlfriends compared to faithful girlfriends, these differences were less pronounced as the aggression intensified. When testing whether perceived norms for IPV were related to participants' purported risk of engaging in IPV, a clear pattern appeared: For the no-infidelity condition, IPV perceived norms for male friends and perceived norms for typical male students were each significantly related to participants' likelihood of engaging in IPV, such that the higher the estimated norm, the higher the participants' risk.

She was afebrile and had an elevated white blood cell count. A non-contrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed pneumocephalus within the subarachnoid space and lateral ventricles. The patient was admitted to the ED observation unit for pain control and subsequently developed a marked leukocytosis and worsening meningismus. A lumbar puncture was performed yielding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) consistent with meningitis (1,000 total nucleated cells, 89% neutrophils, 85mg/dL total protein, and no red blood cells). Gram stain revealed no bacteria. The patient was admitted on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Antibiotics were discontinued at 48h when CSF cultures remained negative and the patient was clinically asymptomatic. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should consider intrathecal entry and pneumocephalus in patients who present with a headache after an epidural intervention. The management of pneumocephalus includes supportive therapies, appropriate positioning, and supplemental oxygen. These symptoms can be accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, and markedly inflammatory CSF findings consistent with bacterial or chemical meningitis. Empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated until CSF culture results are available.", "label": 1}

Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common of hepatic porphyrias and can tax the therapeutic capabilities of the physician to the limit. Motor weakness is a major feature of an acute attack, and flaccid paralysis of all extremities can occur rapidly, within a matter of days. The acute attacks may be life threatening. Hematin (Heme Arginate) should be given early during an acute attack to prevent neurologic sequel. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion have been tried in the treatment of acute attacks of AIP with success. As hematin is not available in India, a severe acute attack of AIP in a patient was managed with hemodialysis successfully. Later, hematin was imported and provided to the patient. An 18-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with recurrent abdominal pain and 2 episodes of convulsions. She had undergone an appendectomy earlier at another hospital for abdominal pain. On evaluation, she had hyponatremia, episodic abnormal behavior, generalized muscle pain, hypertension, and sinus tachycardia. In view of the above clinical picture, a clinical diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria was made. Her 24-hr urinary porphobilinogen was 90.8 mg/day (<2 mg-normal) and alpha amino levalunic acid was 108.8 mg/day (1-7 mg-normal), consistent with the diagnosis. Her hyponatremia was corrected. Arrangements were made to import hematin and she was managed with dextrose infusion. Meanwhile, she developed flaccid quardriparesis with urinary incontinence and bulbar palsy.

He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation.

Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects.

His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications.He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose.

He was previously followed by a psychiatrist for 2 years for additional diagnoses of insomnia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability. He has tried and (apparently) failed multiple psychotropic trials including stimulants, nonstimulants, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. He has a delayed sleep onset and frequent night awakenings each night for the past 3 months, during which he \"screams, cries, and thrashes and can stay up for over an hour.\" His behaviors are described as irritable, self-injurious, and aggressive with no clear pattern of triggers according to his mother. He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation. His mother is concerned that he is developing \"tolerance\" to the regimen and wants to wean him off some of the medications. His mother is struggling to take care of the patient given his worsening behavior and body habitus (body mass index >99%; z = 3.41).There is a family history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism. He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications.He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose. During his psychiatric hospital stay, care coordination succeeded in arranging center-based applied behavior analysis interventions and respite care and parent training for his family.

", "knowledge": "BACKGROUND: Spinal analgesia, mediated by opioid receptors, requires only a fraction of the opioid dose that is needed systemically. By infusing a small amount of opioid into the cerebrospinal fluid in close proximity to the receptor sites in the spinal cord, profound analgesia may be achieved while sparing some of the side effects due to systemic opioids. Intraspinal drug delivery (IDD) has been increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain, when these patients have developed untoward side effects with systemic opioid usage. The introduction of intrathecal opioids has been considered one of the most important breakthroughs in pain management in the past three decades. A variety of side effects associated with the long-term usage of IDD have been recognized. Among them, respiratory depression is the most feared.OBJECTIVE: To describe a severe adverse event, i.e., respiratory failure, following delayed intrathecal morphine pump refill.CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman with intractable chronic low back pain, due to degenerative disc disease, and was referred to our clinic for an intraspinal drug delivery evaluation, after failing to respond to multidisciplinary pain treatment. Following a psychological evaluation confirming her candidacy, she underwent an outpatient patient-controlled continuous epidural morphine infusion trial. The infusion trial lasted 12 days and was beneficial in controlling her pain. The patient reported more than 90% pain reduction with improved distance for ambulation. She subsequently consented and was scheduled for permanent intrathecal morphine pump implantation. The intrathecal catheter was inserted at right paramedian L3-L4, with catheter tip advanced to L1, confirmed under fluoroscopy. Intrathecal catheter placement was confirmed by positive CSF flow and by myelogram. A non-programmable Codman 3000 constant-flow rate infusion pump was placed in the right mid quandrant between right rib cage and right iliac crest. The intrathecal infusion consisted of preservative free morphine, delivering 1.0 mg /day. Over the following 6 months, the dosage was gradually titrated up to 4 mg/day with satisfactory pain control without significant side effects. However, the patient was not able to return to the clinic for pump refill until 12 days later than the previously scheduled pump-refill date. Her pump was accessed and was noted to be empty. Her intrathecal pump was refilled with preservative free morphine, delivering 4 mg/day (the same daily dose as her previous refill). However, on the night of pump refill, 10 hours after the pump refill, the patient was found to be unresponsive by her family members. 911 was called. Upon arriving, paramedics found her in respiratory failure, with shallow breathing at a rate of 5/min, pulse oxymetry showing oxygen saturation about 55-58%. She was emergently intubated on site and rushed to local hospital ER. The on call physician for our clinic was immediately contacted, and advised the administration of intravenous Naloxone. Her respiratory effort improved dramatically after receiving a total of 0.6 mg IV Naloxone IV over 25 minutes. Her intrathecal pump was immediately accessed by clinic on call physician and the remainder of the medication in the catheter space was aspirated. The pump infusate was immediately diluted with preservative free normal saline, to deliver preservative free morphine at 1mg/day. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and extubated the next morning. She recovered fully without any sequelae.CONCLUSION: Loss of opioid tolerance due to delayed pump refill may subject patients to the development of severe respiratory depression. Meticulous approach should be employed when refilling pumps in these patients when their pumps are completely empty. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of this type.", "label": 1}

Telazol is comparable to ketamine in efficacy, and in conjunction with ketamine, has been responsible for one reported human fatality. We report a case of a woman who abused telazol.CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old female employee at a local zoo was found unresponsive by fellow workers in a clean animal treatment room. Initial reports were that she had injected veterinary-grade diazepam and telazol. On-scene paramedics reported her as obtunded and arousable to deep painful stimuli, with gag reflex intact. Systolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg by palpation. A fresh needle puncture mark was present on her right arm; nearby were a syringe, tourniquet, and bottles of each drug. Emergency Department assessment included airway, breathing, circulation, and intravenous access. She was lavaged and given activated charcoal with a cathartic. Shortly after arrival, she became alert and oriented. Family members insisted this was not an overdose. The patient had been previously evaluated for reported episodes of syncope, \"only in the evening, while at work,\" and was prescribed diazepam for anxiety. Product information on telazol was limited to the Veterinary Drug Physician's Desk Reference. A urine drugs-of-abuse screen was positive for benzodiazepines and cannabinoids. The patient subsequently revealed a history of recreational use of telazol. She was discharged to an in-patient detoxification facility, 12 hours postadmission.CONCLUSION: Telazol used in veterinary medicine as an anesthetic agent, is structurally related to ketamine. Telazol causes almost immediate anesthetic effects, and sudden alertness is not uncommon as the effects of the drug subside. Urine drugs-of-abuse screens are unlikely to identify telazol. We report a veterinary worker who abused telazol.", "label": 0}

He had been treated for hypertension since 20 years before the onset of the present illness. In addition, he was operated on a gastric cancer 17 years previously. Otherwise he was doing well until May 29, 1991 (when he was 87-year-old) when he had sudden onset of dysarthria and right facial weakness. He was admitted to our hospital. On admission, general physical examination was unremarkable, and neurologic examination revealed a mentally sound man with slight dysarthria, right facial weakness, orolingual dyskinesia, and dysequilibrium in which he showed difficulty in tandem gait; however, no cerebellar ataxia was noted. A cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis with multiple low density areas in the cerebral white matter. His BUN was 37 mg/dl and Cr 2.2 mg/dl. His neurologic symptoms cleared within the next few weeks and he was discharged with ticlopidine 100 mg q.d.. He had been doing well after the discharge except for gradual worsening of his renal function; his BUN was 65 mg/dl and Cr 3.27 mg/dl in April of 1994. On March 10, 1995, he fell down and hit his back; he became unable to walk because of pain, and he was admitted again on March 16, 1995. On admission, his blood pressure was 170/80 mmHg. There was an 1 + pitting pretibial edema; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed an alert and oriented man, however, Hasegawa's dementia scale was 23/30. Higher cerebral functions as well as cranial nerves were intact. He showed some unsteadiness of gait, however, no motor weakness or ataxia was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, but Chaddock sign was positive bilaterally. Vibration was diminished in the feet, however, pain and touch sensations were intact. Laboratory examination revealed a compression fracture of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Blood count and chemistries were as follows; Hb 7.6 g/dl, Hct 23.3%, TP 6.0 g/dl, Alb 3.6 g/dl, BUN 87 mg/dl, Cr 4.53 mg/dl, T-Chol 174 mg/dl, HDL-Chol 49 mg/dl, Glu 156 mg/dl, Na 142 mEq/L, K 5.4 mEq/L, Cl 115 mEq/L. A urine specimen contained 1 + protein and 1 + glucose, and the sediments contained hyaline casts. A cranial CT scan was essentially same as that taken four years ago. His hospital course was complicated with pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and progressive renal failure. He was treated with intravenous fluid, chemotherapy, and other supportive measures, however, he expired from respiratory failure on April 30, 1995. He was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had Binswanger's disease in the brain, benign nephrosclerosis from arteriolosclerosis due to hypertension, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. Opinions were divided regarding the question as to whether or not this patient had Binswanger's disease. Although his cranial CT scan revealed leukoaraiosis, his dementia and gait disturbance was only mild until his fall on March, 1995. Clinical features did not conform to those of Binswanger's disease. Postmortem examination of the right hemisphere revealed wide spread atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. The kidney showed benign nephrosclerosis due to arteriolosclerosis. Sclerotic changes were also seen in the coronary arteries and the left middle cerebral artery with 70% stenosis. Myelin stain showed diffuse myelin pallor of the cerebral white matters with scattered small infarcts. Arterioles in the white matter showed arteriolosclerosis. Small infarcts were also seen in the putamen and in the thalamus. This patient appeared to have had circulatory disturbance of the white matter which is the basic abnormality causing Binswanger's disease. However, white matter changes in this patient were not quite severe enough to make a pathologic diagnosis of Binswanger's disease.", "label": 1}

He did not respond to prednisone 50 mg and 6-mercaptopurine 100 mg daily. Abdominal computed tomography findings revealed diffuse submucosal edema consistent with extensive colitis. Colonoscopy demonstrated diffuse inflammation with erythema, friability, and shallow ulcerations in the rectum and colon. Biopsies were consistent with Crohn's colitis. He was admitted for infliximab infusion for his unremitting diarrhea. Five days before admission, the patient noted mild swelling and redness of the left lower eyelid, which progressed to involve the right lower eyelid with frank pus draining from both eyes. He had no visual impairment or eye pain. Two days before admission, an ophthalmologist prescribed a steroid eyedrop with no relief. He also complained of seropurulent painful skin lesions on his face and scalp, which spread to involve his upper trunk and proximal arms. On admission to the hospital, dermatology, ophthalmology, and infectious disease consultations were obtained to rule out disseminated infection before initiation of infliximab therapy. The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His oral mucosa was normal. He had prominent bilateral lower eyelid edema, erythema, and superficial erosions with hemorrhagic crusting and frank green purulent drainage from both eyes, with crusting along the lower lash line and bilateral sclera injection (Figure 1). On his scalp, face, trunk, and proximal extremities, he had 25 to 30 erythematous, 4- to 8-mm papulopustules with narrow red halos, some with central necrosis and crusting (Figure 2). Cultures from the purulent ocular drainage and pustules on the trunk and arms were all negative for bacteria, virus, and fungi. Gram stain from the eye drainage showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes without organisms. Tissue cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infection. Skin biopsy taken from the central upper back demonstrated subcorneal pustules with areas of eroded epidermis and collections of neutrophils in the superficial dermis (Figure 3). Special stains were negative for organisms. He received infliximab infusion 5 mg/kg for a total dose of 420 mg over 2 hours. Within 48 hours of infusion, there was notable decrease in size of lesions, in addition to reduction of purulent drainage from both eyes. The patient was discharged home following infliximab infusion. His skin lesions resolved during a period of 2 weeks, leaving small pink atrophic scars. He received his second infusion of infliximab 2 weeks after discharge with continued improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms.", "label": 1}
